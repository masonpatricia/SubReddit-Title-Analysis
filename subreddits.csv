It's very disappointing. The organization run by retards called the FDA barely announced a couple years ago that the cholesterol in foods do not impact cholesterol in the body. They forgot to announce that what really does impact blood cholesterol, and causes diabetes and heart disease, is sugar and carbs. They'll probably announce that in 5-10 years I predict. They should also announce that they're a bunch of dumb asses taking up tax payer dollars, and that they've been wrong for the last 30 years about food, and single handedly caused the diabetes and obesity epidemic, by scaring the entire world to avoid fat. Diabetes and obesity was not an epidemic 50 years ago when Americans were eating fat. But it is now. Good fucking job, FDA! You useless piece of shit organization.

I'm sure everyone in here who's keto-ing and eating fat and cholesterol high foods can vouch that their lipid panels and blood tests are the best they're ever seen, since they quit eating carbs. Carbs are poison. ALL Fats are healthy and better than a bowl of rice or bread. Yes, ALL fats (except, of course, banned and illegalized substances such as Trans fat). Even the oil grease left over from frying pork. It's healthy and much healthier than carbs. 

I'm just pissed off and needed a place to rant. I'm not even on the keto diet anymore, but my diet is full of fat and protein, with just enough carbs for my daily glycogen needs. I know not to overconsume them, or I'm going to become another victim of the FDA.",1

Before finding Keto, I was eating out every single day. Gorging myself. I couldn't get by without a 2 liter of Coca Cola. French fries were my BFF. If I didn't have something I absolutely LOVED, I was NOT satisfied. I didn't have the money to do this, but I did it anyway and it drove me so far into debt.

When I switched to Keto, I tried doing everything perfectly with clean ingredients, counting macros, etc. It worked. I felt better. I even spent less money. But I totally missed out on enjoying food and that made me feel super depressed. Everything I ate had to be prepared and socializing was such a process, all the time. I mostly did this clean way of eating because that's what various ""experts"" on keto told me. Needless to say, I fell off and on the keto train for about 2 years.

I then started making choices that may be considered ""less than ideal."" I would eat fast food burgers without the bun, enjoy a taco made from a low carb tortilla (seriously, I would eat one giant taco per day for a couple weeks), and I was still drinking my Coke Zero (it's very much a great substitute than the full sugar version IMO). My weight loss picked back up (although a little slower), but I felt better mentally, and my stomach issues were still improved. All things I loved about eating completely clean keto.

I am not trying to say that eating clean is bad, but I do know that I see so many people quit because it just isn't sustainable. Or even enjoyable. Make conscious choices about what you're having. That's kind of been my philosophy for the past three years, and I've been able to lose about 90 pounds and keep it off effortlessly.

With that being said, if Lazy Keto is the only way you can make it work, freakin do it! Sure beats the constant yo-yo diet effect or falling completely off the wagon. Make it work for you.

"""Starvation Mode"" on keto",0,1fxeo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1fxeo0/starvation_mode_on_keto/,17,1370731919.0,"Sorry, posted this in the wrong sub forum...first time posting. Sorry if it seems a bit wordy, I don't know how to adequately explain my thoughts about this without confusing people! I've wondered this for awhile and never found a concrete answer.

So, its well-known that eating keto causes major appetite suppression for many people. I often struggle to eat more than 800-900 calories when my fat macro is so high (often, 75-80%). I've been freaking out lately that my metabolism is going to slow down because I'm not eating enough. So this got me thinking about ""starvation mode""--when you fuel your body with insufficient calories for a long enough period of time that your metabolism eventually becomes depressed and slows down.

I'm not so sure I believe in starvation mode regardless (if it was true, then nobody would starve to death, right?)..but I wonder about how starvation mode would effect fat-burners (like us keto eaters) vs glucose-burners (SAD eaters)..

Suppose ""starvation mode"" begins to kick in when the body realizes its being starved of calories. For glucose-burners, this means not eating enough carbs and the body switching over to burning stored fats. Would this change of a fuel source serve as a signal to start conserving calories by depressing metabolism? Starvation mode claims that yes, it would.

Now, what about fat-burners? When we don't eat enough calories, how would our bodies ""know""? We burn the fats we eat, and then we continue to burn stored fats when we are eating in a calorie deficit. Are we spared the effect of a slowed metabolism because our fuel source is constant? Are we less likely to suffer from a depressed metabolism and starvation mode than our SAD-eating counterparts? Can our body tell the difference between calories coming from dietary fat and calories coming from stored fat?",1

[AFTER](https://imgur.com/a/uAZVBk4)

* Emotional eating is a habit that was planted into me since I was young enough to associate happiness with pastries/candy/comfort food. Breaking this habit (or resisting it) is essential to successful keto. Life goes wrong all the time. I've gone through SO much this year that resulted in me binging for weeks at a time, hating myself for it, and binging more. IT'S OKAY TO SLIP. If you're a food addict like me, relapses **are going to happen.** Be kind to yourself and just hop back on keto and reflect.

* Do take photos along the way. When I was my heaviest I didn't even look in the mirror, let alone take full body photos. I have a couple, and started taking photos along the way. It's motivational, trust me. How you looked in July vs. how you look in October will be very different!! Celebrate that change with photos. :)

* Although I am very close to 50 lbs down, keto is still a challenge for me. I live around all of my favorite foods (pupusas, tacos, chilli cheese fries, tamales... *drool*) and it still takes all of my willpower to go just put a burger over a bed of spinach and call it a night. Not everyone is like this, but if you are, it's okay! It's part of the journey to unlearn toxic eating habits, mindsets, and behaviors. Reading Michael Moss' *Salt Sugar Fat: How The Food Giants Hooked Us* motivates me too lol.

I've never been the one to share on the internet, and don't have any social media profiles, mainly due to confidence issues from not prioritizing health in my life, but today I'm finding an urge to share a little bit of what I learned from my journey for those out there that have been teetering on the idea of hopping on keto to help with their health/fitness goals, and to maybe help give some morale for those that are having a difficult time with the obstacles  many of us have faced and are facing!

&#x200B;

A few personal points I've come to realize along my Keto journey;

1. **Keto is a tool. Carbs are not bad. Carbs can be used as a tool as well.**

\- At one point in all of this, I found myself demonizing carbs, this was not a good outlook. And incredibly misguiding.

2. **Uncomfortability is inevitable, but not impossible. You CAN do this!**

\-  ""Discipline is the invisible bridge between goals and accomplishments. Discipline is doing what you don't want to do in pursuit of what you want"" - Jim Rohn

3. **Research... Research... Research. There is so much misinformation out there, it is scary.**

\- Try and side with opinions that are followed by recent studies. Maybe dip into researching the basics into nutrition if you haven't already.

4. **It's COMPLETELY OK if you slip up. Don't beat yourself up after binging pizza and cookies... Sometimes... s\*\*\* happens.**

\-I've found myself beating myself up over the slightest slip ups and to be honest, it's not worth the mental real estate of feeling guilty. Be happy and be vigilant.

**5. Consider investing into some home gym equipment. Small or big. Anything that gets the blood flowing! I highly recommend a row machine.**

\- Exercise and Keto is an INCREDIBLE DUO to keep things summarized. Also there aren't many things out there in the world that can buy you time in your life. Commute / life expectancy.

I started Keto on a whim 5/5 of this year. The initial loss hooked me quick. I started making better food choices a few weeks in and religiously weighing and logging my food. I also incorporated intermittent fasting and have done that pretty much daily since a month in. I don’t cheat at all on my diet and been under 20 net carbs the entire time. 

I’ve went from 455lbs to 342lbs in 5 months (113lbs gone). 5xl to 2-3xl and 54” pants to 46” pants. My mood, anxiety, and depression are all so much better. Sleep like a log and no longer snore or have apnea (what I’m told). My energy is through the roof and I’m being a lot more active. No more joint pain or inflammation. I can’t stress enough how great this is for me. 

I eat on average 1700 cals a day. 12 carb, 125 fat, 125 protein. Keto has been a godsend for me. It allows me to easily hit my calorie and macro goals without ever being hungry ever. IF takes this to a whole new level and really controls hunger hormones. I’m about to break a 44 hour fast right now and feel like a million bucks. 

I just got some blood work back and was super pleased with the results A1C 4.6, fasting glucose 75, total cholesterol 180, blood pressure 107/65.

I’m excited to really get after it and keep crushing it to get it all the way off for good. The plan is to eat this way for life I could never see going back. This sub is a huge motivation for me. I read it daily. Thank you all!

So far it's been exactly one year into keto and intermittent fasting (20:4) and I've lost 135 lbs. I'd like to thank everyone in this subreddit for keeping me motivated as well as educated. Also would like to thank Dr. Eric Berg (definitely recommend his youtube channel)

If you're thinking about keto please do yourself the favor and just start. you deserve to be happy, you deserve more energy, you deserve to be the best you. If I could do it anyone can just take it one day at a time! I started at almost 400 lbs and today I'm almost out of the 200's. It can be done and no surgery is needed just hard work and dedication

And I am getting really tired of all the meat eating.   We are making lots of different stuff,  but at a function this week there was chocolate gonache cake,  and you know what it was the best fucking piece of cake I have ever eaten in my life.   You say cravings go away after a while,  but I don't think I will ever not want to eat that cake. We are eating at a 20% deficit,  following the keto diet,  drinking enough water,  getting electrolytes, recording every bite of food and not cheating.    I don't have any of the fat people medical problems,  bp-normal,  cholesterol - 105,  no diabetes issues,  just fat. I don't want any of those things that is why I am trying to do this diet.   How do you get around  hating it?  Sometimes I think I was happier just being fat,  and eating a normal American diet. ",1

So I re-started Keto on July 11th. Final supper of fish & chips, and I haven't looked back.

Took this pic after me and my daughter had our hair done on August 3rd and realised my face was just swollen. Eww. I hate taking pics so apologies for the lack of quality and my face 😂

 I've always struggled with weight but this is something else. 

Feeling low this week so decided I would go for a walk. Took today's pic before. Shocked! 

This is what approx. 40lbs loss looks like for me. Could be more I'm only weighing once a month, (still another 130lbs to go). But I wasn't ready for this, the mirror does lie, my face still looks awful in that. But even I can see a difference, I needed that today.

I always used to hate my body and struggled a lot with self-esteem. Yeah, I look better now, but most importantly I am just in awe as to how much one's body can change when you take care of it. Most other times when I have lost weight on crash diets and what not, I never really gained any self-esteem. I still felt terrible physically and mentally. A diet is so much more than just losing weight. It really does impact almost every facet of your life. I finally found a way of eating that really permeated my life in a really positive way.

So I have been Keto for about a year now. I definitely have not been really strict, and I have been on and off of it. But I have lost about 33 pounds (which is a lot for us short girl!). And I have absolutely fallen in love with the process of getting healthy and cherishing the beautiful thing that is my body. 

NSVs: My sciatica is mostly gone; my low blood sugar is gone; the numbness and tingling in my limbs is gone; My energy is back; I've learned how to cook pretty proficiently, and now cook 99% of all my meals; I feel confident in my body; I care about the actual health of my body; my libido is back; i fit in all of my clothes again (closet shopping FTW!)...the list could really go on for a long time, but I thought those were the most important and relatable ones. 

This sub has really been my rock during this process--seriously love all of you guys. I still want to lose about 10-15 more pounds, but I don't care as much about that anymore. I just want to keep feeling great and not get diabetes. 

Lets exchange recipes and talk about how keto has made an amazing impact on our lives!

I started Keto on a whim on Cinco de Mayo 5/5. I weighed in at 455lbs the highest number I’ve ever seen on a scale. Found this sub then read, read, and read some more and have had a lot of success eating a ketogenic diet. I’m blown away about how much better I feel all around. Anxiety/depression has vastly improved. I went from pre diabetic to perfect numbers with an AIC of 4.7. Super high cholesterol to normal. 190/115 blood pressure to 115/75 regularly. I try to hit a 20:4 IF schedule everyday but it doesn’t always happen. Today, 8 months later,  I weigh 313lbs. Lately I’ve been hiking and backpacking burning a shit load of calories. Hiker hunger is real but I’ve been dropping weight consistently. 

About 11 years ago I got down to from 420 to 289 for about a half of a day. I was under 300lbs for maybe 10 days smh. Not this time. Something is different, I feel so confident that I’ve finally got this thing figured out. 

Today I bought my plane ticket to Atlanta for March. I plan to give it my all and compete a northbound thru hike of the Appalachian trail. Georgia to Maine 2200 miles and 4-6 months of walking. Only 10% of folks who set out to thru hike the entire trail complete it. I’m so ready for the challenge and adventure I want to leave now.  I could barely walk up the stairs 8 months ago now I climb mountains. I plan to remain on Keto on the trail, even though it’s gonna be a pain in the ass acquiring enough keto friendly calories out there. 

If I can do this anybody can. Newbies stick with it it’s so worth it. I feel liberated beyond words from my self. Nobody knows what it’s like to be morbidly obese with zero hope unless you’ve been there. I’ve been there and you can change if you want to. Love y’all and this community it’s one of the true good places in a creepy internet world.

It's a day I had hoped for but never thought I would ever see. On the left, we see me before caring about my health and in the middle and right, we see a picture of me from today (with terrible bed hair).That my friends is a 300 lb difference. Sometimes you need to hit rock bottom in order to really make a change. My rock bottom was me going to the doctor because my heart was palpitating and the doctor telling me I was pre-diabetic and that he was putting me on pills. At 25, I fucking refused  let this be my life. I didn't know how I was going to do it, but I knew that this time, I was going to lose weight. Luckily I found Atkins /low carb and later keto and here we are. I went from a 7XL shirt to now being able to pull off an LT. Thanks to a little dedication (stubbornness more than anything else), 300 lbs is gone that will never come back. I refuse to ever go back to how I was. It hasn't always been easy. Even though the diet itself is straight forward there's times where I've over thought ever single I've eaten because I was afraid in the back of mind that it would cause me to go back to the me on the left (scared to have that piece of pizza, or bite of cake, etc) . I've gotten alot better but it still sometimes lingers in the back of my mind. But I ultimately know that if I ever do have a set back, I won't let it undo everything I've worked hard to do these last few years. My best piece of advice for anyone that does want to lose weight is just to start somewhere. Go for walks, count carbs or calaries, go to the gym, find a diet that works for you. I feel like diet plays the biggest part of losing weight. Not popping some bullshit pill or drinking some bullshit shake, it has to come from you. I'm still not quite at my final goal, I'd like to lose 25 lbs more but I can honestly say, I'm so glad I hit this milestone. I'm grateful that according to my most recent labs, I'm in good health all around. And more importantly, for my family and friends that have been there since the beginning and never encouraging me to continue. #lowcarb #keto #atkins #diet #bacon

I've been doing keto for about 6 months and just figured out that this subreddit exists :-) I've mainly been using regional swedish resources such as [dietdoctor.com](https://dietdoctor.com) so I think I still have gotten pretty decent information, but the sharing of stories and victories you have going on here is amazing!

 

So I thought I would share one myself, [https://i.imgur.com/Sbpj8wL.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Sbpj8wL.jpg) I really, really wish I took before-photos of myself when I started but I did not, so that was the best photo of me before I started that I could find. My weightloss at the moment is 22 kg or 48,5 punds. I started at 92 kg (202,8 pounds) and are now at 70 kg (154,3 pounds). I'm 35 years old and 182cm or about 6"" tall. I'm not planning on losing any more weight so the new mission is to replace the lost fat with muscles.

 

I did not do anything most of you people don't already know about, 20g carbs max a day and burning about 500 - 1000 kcal more than I eat each day. Recepies were mostly from [dietdoctor.com](https://dietdoctor.com). I ate quite large portions based of that site so to keep the kcal deficiency I walked to work as often as I could, went to the gym and took long walks with my dog in all weather. ( Bonus photo of the dog [https://i.imgur.com/1IinWEu.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/1IinWEu.jpg) ) I keept track of the intake and burn with my smartwatch, and I know they are known for not beeing very accurate, but it seems to have been accurate enough for me!

 

If you are just starting, take those damn before photos, you'll hate them. Hide them away and look at them a few months later. You'll be glad you did!",1

I've only been doing keto for 3 months but the changes in my life have been so amazing, I just can't believe it. I decided to start keto not only for weight loss, but because I was diagnosed with PCOS and insulin resistance. I read that cutting out carbs + sugar help with both, so I decided to give it a go.

I noticed health improvements after only a week and my life has been completely turned around. I get home from work and have SO MUCH GODDAMN ENERGY I just wanna clean the house 5 times over and meal prep for months and work on all these projects I never had enough energy or motivation for before and omg. I have achieved so much on my to-do lists in the last 3 months than I have in the past 3 years.

I had a lot of hair loss from my PCOS and now my hair is GROWING BACK AGAIN!!! I just want to cry. I was seriously looking at buying a wig 3 months ago.  

And guess who no longer has crippling depression, anxiety and panic attacks every week? THIS GIRL RIGHT HERE

To top it all off, I had a naughty day yesterday and ate way too much calories (I was meal prepping for the week AND making some keto fat bombs and was taste testing everything in sight) and I STILL LOST WEIGHT THIS MORNING. WHAT THE HECK.  

I just can't believe it. How can keto be this amazing? HOW

I hate talking to friends and family about keto because they get constantly make fun of me when I decline eating something at a gathering plus I can't stand those preachy keto/vegan/gluten free kinda people but goddamn, I feel like everyone should be eating a least a little keto

I just wanted to share how freakin' happy and excited I am. I can't believe just simply cutting carbs and sugar has COMPLETELY changed my life. I don't even miss those fuckers.

[https://postimg.cc/gallery/1nrs8sew6/](https://postimg.cc/gallery/1nrs8sew6/)

So I lost a lot of weight in one year.  Maybe that's an understatement.  I've been going back and forth on whether to post my update or not.  I'm not trying to brag or show off.  I'm posting more for motivation for people who haven't started Keto or are just beginning. If i can do it, so can you.  

  
Quick story:

Life was not great Pre\-Keto.  I was over 500lbs.  I don't know my exact weight because no scale I had could weigh me.  I had problems getting around. I couldn't stand for long periods of time. I constantly was sweating and always hot.  I'm still upset that I let myself get so bad.  When people say i look great I'm more embarrassed for how I looked to begin with.  

It took me ruining a family vacation to Universal Studios to begin the process in my mind that I have to lose weight.  I was looking forward to going to the Harry Potter area for years.  I was so excited when we got there.  However, I could barely get around.  Walking around was nearly impossible.  I would have to strategically plan my steps and look ahead for a bench to rest.  I ended up seeing a fraction of the Harry Potter area and instead went to an restaurant w/ AC just so I wouldn't have to walk around.  One day, I will have to make it up to my wife and son and take them back so we actually enjoy Universal Studios.  I wish I could say I went home and began Keto. It would take me another 8 months before I actually decided to start this 'journey'.  

Like I said, I don't know my exact weight when i started.  It took me about 5 months before I actually got on a scale.  I was frightened to see the number that would be staring back at me.  I can guesstimate it was over 500lbs as the first time I weighed myself I was @ 386.  I have to figure in 5 months I lost over 114lbs.   

My diet regimen: I went right into One meal a day.  For me it was really easy.  I stayed in a calorie range from 800\-1100 a day.  I know that is VERY low and definitely not for everyone.  However,  I never felt like i was starving or famished.  I quickly got into a groove and never looked back.  It helps that I'm stubborn and not a quitter. If I commit to something I'm not going to give up. I never had a cheat day or meal (nor will I).  I know cheat days are not bad but I would feel awful if i ever went off the rails.

I only weighed myself once a month.  I dont want to do live and die w/ the scale.  At Halloween I was 386, when I last weighed myself on June 1 i was 229.  I think the secret for me on Keto was meal planning and cooking in bulk.  I'd smoke a pork shoulder or some chicken on Sunday and have food for the next week or longer.  

These items made Keto easy for me:

\-Cauliflower rice was a god send.  There is so much I have done with it.

\-Shirataki noodle. They are not for everyone but I love them.

\-Butt Rub. It's a great spice and it's very Keto friendly

\-Rao's Pasta sauce.   I love that stuff.  Low in carbs and so tasty.

I started out wearing 7xl and 8xl tshirts.  My shorts and sweats were 4xl.  

Today, i'm wearing an XL shirt and L shorts.  Yes, there is A LOT of hanging skin.

 When I reflect on my weight loss and where I came from, I think of a movie line from Apollo 13.  It's when Tom Hanks is talking to Kathleen Quinlan after their party looking at the Moon and what it took to get there.

Edit: Thanks for the great words of encouragement everyone. Looking at the pictures I feel ashamed that I ever let myself get to that point, but because of Keto I'm healthier, happier, and have more energy.

Here's a little story about how bad my weight was. Back before my sister's wedding, I would hang out at her and her husband's place which was literally two blocks from a 7-11. We would always make a trip down to the 7-11 for some unhealthy eating and my calves would be on fire halfway to the 7-11. I still had 3/4 of a trip to go and I was severely struggling. After about 4 months and 45 pounds lost I was invited to Universal Studios. I knew a walk down 1 block was previously a struggle for me, so wad a bit nervous about the pain from walking around an amusement park. I walked through that park for around 10 hours without a bit a pain. That's when I really started noticing the effects of the Keto diet.

Just keep sticking to it and if you don't at first notice the changes size wise, start looking at the small difficulties you've previously had (like pain from walking) and you may see the encouraging effects of the diet.

Thanks everyone!

Hi all, my name is Mary and I started this journey a year ago on September 7th. So many things have changed for me. Not only my weight, but I feel more comfortable in my body than I ever have. I can tie my own shoes, I’m not winded after taking only a few steps. Standing up, and getting out of bed are no longer painful, and my quality of life in general has improved. I’m no longer insulin resistant. I have energy when I wake up in the morning and it’s sustained throughout the day. I’ve only had one migraine in the past year when they used to be a monthly occurrence. It wasn’t until I began to lose weight that I realized how unhealthy I was. I had been morbidly obese from an early age, and it felt normal to me. I knew nothing else. My body was fighting to keep me alive. I owe it to myself to take care of myself. I’ve made mistakes, and I’ll keep making them. My progress has slowed the past few months, I’ve been maintaining, but I am going to finish what I started. Keto and intermittent fasting has changed my life in so many wonderful ways. I’m so proud of myself and what I’ve managed to accomplish, this wasn’t easy and the choices I make everyday aren’t easy either. I came to realize that both the passing of my father and the sexual abuse I faced from a family member as a child and the culmination of unfortunate life events had everything to do with why I turned to food for solace. I had to face the pain and emotional trauma that I’ve buried into my body, and the reasons I gained and consoled myself with food. I’ll be honest it was difficult to take a long hard look at what happened to me, and the fact that what I was doing was an internalized form of self harm. I didn’t deserve that, but now the healing can begin. The reason I say this is because I know there are many people who internalize pain in the same way that I did. There’s so much to look forward to, you just have to keep pushing. I hope this post inspires some of you. This community had been a bedrock of support for me, and I’m so grateful for all of you. Here’s to a year of progress, and here’s to many more.",1

My new doctor suggested I look into it being that I have thyroid and hormone issues that leave me absolutely exhausted, she said it was worth trying it so here I am.

 I have two toddlers, work a typical Monday-Friday full time desk job, a partner that travels a few days a week for work, so needless to say the days can be exhausting, but yesterday it’s as if this magic switch flipped and when the kids went to bed I cleaned the house, decluttered a ton of their old toys, meal prepped for today, did laundry, and cleaned the laundry room and bagged up a bunch of old clothes to donate. When I started doing dishes at 9pm I was getting a little emotional because I NEVER have this kind of energy ever and usually when the kids go to bed at 7ish I was too exhausted to do anything but flop on the couch and whine about how tired I felt.

I really thought this way of eating was going to be so impossible for me - I am totally a sugar addict and have quit sugar and sweetners before (only to go back to massive binges) but this is the first time I have ever thought about carbs in my life and the cravings are just... not there. It really is bizarre to me, I don’t even care about the bakery section and I don’t need the willpower to say no to cookies because I just don’t want them.

I’m so happy. I really hope this is a sign of how things are going to be, and if I have even that sort of energy one day a week it will be a huge difference. 

I FEEL SO IN CONTROL! Woke up to a decluttered clean house, which is instant good mood, had all my stuff prepped for work so I had a leisurely morning getting ready and having FUN with my kids instead of being stressed and rushed. 

It’s crazy how keto is making all aspects of my life better, I honestly have not felt this good in ages and I am so happy and thank you to r/keto!!!

Today is the day. After just shy of 24 weeks, I hit the 100 pound mark. 

Like most folks here, I’ve battled my weight for as long I can remember. The cycle always looked like this: exercising a ton, get used to eating more, get hurt, get fat, hit the point to which I couldn’t take it anymore, start exercising a ton combined with strict dieting, get hurt, rinse and repeat. Not only would I put all of the weight back on, but that number would make significant leaps upward before I would find the motivation to make a change. In college, it was 235. A few years after college, it was 265. Then it grew to 300, and recently, was 330. 

I had hit 330 in 2014. Disgusted with myself and miserable, I made a commitment to exercise more and follow the WW program. Before long, I was doing multiple hours of cardio 4-5 days a week. After completing a 13-mile run just to see if I could, the decision was made to train for a marathon. The weight came pouring off, but I found I needed to carb load to get through the 36 miles I was running each week. After finishing five full marathons and numerous halves that year, I was down to 236. Then I pulled a hamstring. This was followed by a torn meniscus. My running career was over, but I kept eating in the same way. 

Couple this with a move from frontline firefighting work to a desk job, and I put on 80 pounds in just over eight months. After reaching 328 in 2016, I finally pulled myself together. This time it was WW and heavy gym activity. A botched knee surgery left me with the pool and elliptical as my only options; so I attacked them with same ferocity I had my running. The weight came off (down to 265), but I quickly burnt out. I hated what I had to eat and quickly tired of swimming laps and spinning wheels on machines. 

By this past summer, I was back up to around 330 again. But this time, I just couldn’t find the motivation. I knew I didn’t want to do WW, and I knew I couldn’t stomach the elliptical. I could run two or three times before the pain was too great, but that obviously wasn’t enough to make a difference. At the same time, I couldn’t take it anymore. I was tired of the stares, of the disbelieving or shameful looks when people found out I worked for the fire department, having to be concerned about fitting into booths or airplane seats, and the quickly diverted eyes. Still, for months, I just couldn’t get over the motivational hump. 

On Labor Day weekend, my wife and I visited Las Vegas with some friends. This was the straw that broke the camel’s back. The plane ride was absolutely brutal. There was a moment of panic when it looked like I would need a seatbelt extender and I had to sit balled up as tight as I possible could for four hours both ways. In Vegas, I could feel the eyes on me and sense the utter lack of respect I was receiving. For some reason, it really hit me hard.

It made me ponder who I really am - what do I believe in and who do I aspire to be? How had I gotten to this point? What did the best version of myself look like and how do I get there? This self-examination was coupled with one of the people we were with introducing me to Keto - and the rest is history. 

Over the next six months, I went on to drop 100 pounds. I did this with minimal exercise and eating food I find delicious. While me caloric intake was cut considerably, it was much easier to handle knowing I was going to have an amazing ribeye later that night. There were definitely tough periods, but the way the weight was falling off helped me to stay motivated. 

Now, this is a way of life. My blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels have all improved immensely. The weight loss has allowed me to run again (ran 5.5 miles around downtown last night). I’ve taken off over 14 inches around my waist. The only bad thing I can say is that I have literally nothing to wear that doesn’t look ridiculous. While I will eventually up my carbs from under 20 to under 50, I do not see altering my diet anytime in the next few years. 

On top of all of this, I am weeks away from finishing my Masters, applying for a doctoral program, midway through the National Fire Academy’s EFO program, and overseeing one of the biggest projects in my department’s history. There is no way I would have had the energy or focus to tackle all of this seven months ago. 

The reason I believe this change will last is because it hasn’t been exercise dependent. It’s built on a lifestyle change that I find pretty easy to maintain. I lost the weight by changing what I eat, not compensating for what I eat. I’ve also reached the point of realizing that I enjoy how I feel all day everyday far longer and more intensely than the joy a piece of cake or cookie would provide. Also, the difficulty I had getting over the hump this last time really shook me. 

Thank you to this community. Thank you to my friend from the trip and a friend here in town. Thank you to my wife and family. I’ve tried to pay it forward and be there for others on this journey both here and in my “real life.”  The ripple effect of your help continues to grow.

I’m happy with the improvements I’ve seen, my hopefully improved health outlook, and the foods I get to eat. I wouldn’t have a problem continuing on this track. I do love Asian cuisines, and while they are fairly easily to adapt to this lifestyle, eating out occasionally can be limiting given the number of dishes with fish sauce or oyster sauce (I’m thinking Thai, especially). I’m not sure why I would exclude them in the future. Adding a tablespoon of fish sauce seems a far cry from eating a steak. Does anyone know if occasional forays out of vegan have health impacts?

I still have my bacon cheeseburgers, just without the bun and fries. I still eat MOST of my favorite (and convenient) foods, and that's why it works for me.

Admittedly, the hardest temptation I have to overcome is the chips and salsa on the table at Mexican restaurants. I live in Arizona where the Mexican food is killer, and I cry a little every time. My favorite reminder is that I've had 30+ years of eating like an asshole and passing on the chips is not a deprivation whatsoever.

So here I am, standing all of 5 foot 3 inches tall, from 340lbs to 239.9lbs. Thoroughly enjoying fitting into booths, having extra slack on the seat belt, and the ability to cross my legs under my desk.

So, here I am again. Still being extremely strict with my keto process. I've remained <50g carbs every day since my start date. No cheats. And boy do I feel amazing. The compliments are rollin in from every where and I kinda don't know how to act.



I've been overweight since I was a kid. This is the lightest I've been since I was 13 years old. I wear a size 42 jeans now. Smallest since I was 11 years old. It's wild. Like, I don't even know how to be this person that I am now! But I love learning how every day. 

So far, I've cured my hypertension, depression, anxiety, sugar addiction, chronic joint pain, and chronic rejection-from-the-opposite-sex syndrome too.

Thanks for all the support! KCKO, y'all.

EDIT: 
Thanks so much for the kind words.
People are asking about my carb consumption as my loss was really fast and the number I've mentioned seems high. Here's my reply to one such comment:

""This synopsis is kinda misleading. I've been over 20g [of carbs] in a day MAYBE 5 times. Shoot for as low as you can, but I'd much rather say under 50 than under 20 and risk betraying my character with that dishonesty.""

here I am on ig if you guys wanna keep up further! www.instagram.com/bradley.wilkerson

EDIT 3:

lots of questions about my daily habits... I think this is an important reply:

""When I first began I did absolutely no artificial sweeteners. I drank la croix. I wouldn't recommend turning to flavored drinks to curb a craving. The point is to develop a more healthy relationship with food from the root outward, and I strongly believe that using replacement type foods and sweeteners defeats the purpose.

When I began, I created a macro tracker in a Google spreadsheet. I used this religiously until I was able to look at a portion of most foods that I would regularly eat and determine the macros.

Electrolytes, I use cheap potassium and magnesium pills from walmart. 400mg magnesium per day, 1300mg potassium per day. I get salt from other foods pretty easily.

I also quit caffeine for the first 3 months. I wanted to give my adrenals a chance to heal and function properly. If you have to have coffee, go for it. The brand is a gimmick, however, and mycotoxins are such a negligible risk that selling overpriced coffee as a solution for it is, in my opinion, highly disingenuous.

Snacks, I just wouldn't recommend snacking. Eat your meals, let them digest and then be empty as your body works on its fat stores.

I think the biggest problem for most people is wanting to keep their eating habits comfortable with snacking and satiating cravings, but I believe you need to be uncomfortable. It shouldn't feel natural to you because your default behavior patterns are what got you here - wanting to change. But it will feel GOOD to you and your body. soon.

Good luck!""",1

&#x200B;

Well I woke up this morning officially 101 lbs down after 7.5 months!!!! I cried a little and had to step on and off the scale several times before it registered. I began this journey back in August at 335lbs. I realized at 24 years old that there was sooo much I wanted to do in life that was being prohibited by my weight. Keto has truly been the best decision I have made. Period.

I started going to the gym 3-4 day a week right before new year’s which caused a slight stall in weight loss, but I have def seen my body composition changing to a more toned one. I also do IF and have recently begun more extended fasts of 3-5 days.

Some things I am proud of:

I went from a size 24 pants to a 14 and a 3x in shirts to large.

I'm not out of breath walking upstairs or walking in general

Body aches and pains I assumed were normal have disappeared (I now realize these were not normal for a 24 yr old girl lol).

I can say no when free food is offered. This was VERY hard for me to do before, even if I had just eaten.

My skin looks and feels AMAZING.

I am more confident.

I am starting to have a healthy relationship with food. My binging tendencies have subsided substantially. If I do have a slip up it is ALWAYS with keto foods.

I am HAPPY! Truly happy. Friends and family notice the difference not only in my physical appearance, but an overall change

&#x200B;

I am over the moon and can't wait to meet my next goal!

I’m much more outgoing than I ever had any chance of being before. Losing the weight changed everything for me. I take pride in my appearance now, and I’d always thought I was an ugly bastard lol.

Sometimes you need to do an ol' side by side or two to remind yourself just how far you've come, especially during those rough days when you're getting down on yourself. 

Reminding myself, and anyone else who may need it, take a breath, take it one day at a time, and don't forget to give yourself the credit that you deserve - even for the smallest of victories!

I started when me and my roommate did “no fun February”. We wanted to go a month without alcohol, weed, or sugary snacks just for shits and giggles. After about a week I decided to try Keto after hearing about it on JRE a few times. I also started intermittent fasting about the same time. After the first month I lost 28 pounds and had no difficulty at all sticking  with the diet. The sugar was hard at first but I’ve found alternatives that keep me satisfied. It’ll be 6 months on the 1st of August and I’ve now lost 110 pounds and pants have gone from 44-32.

Ive always been heavier then most in my entire life , but after I dropped out of school in 2016 due to stress and personal struggles, I started eating more and moving less. 


about 11 months later my weight had skyrocketed to 324 Lbs or 147 kg. I wasn't happy I was depressed doing nothing at home wasting my life, eating myself to death. offcourse I knew there was something wrong and I had tried to lose weight before, but it never worked I always fell back into bad habits.


I don't know what it was but on January 8th I flipped a switch in my head, I decided it was enough I was done this is no way too live I HAD to choose either I eat myself to an early death or I turn my life around. Luckily I choose well that day.


I ordered a 2 week protein diet packet online and started the day it arrived, after I was one week in I realised I had to learn more about the science behind it. I went online and found this subreddit I couldn't believe it , there was actually a way to eat delicious food and lose weight.


after the 2 week cold turkey protein diet packet i delved into keto with the help of this subreddit and I started hiking every week with my father. I couldn't believe it it actually worked ! I was losing weight and I wasn't hungry or Craving snacks. I educated myself in calories , nutrition and keto for me it has been a miracle.


Now a year later im a changed person , ive picked up school again although in an alternative way to get my diploma , ive lost 115 lbs and ive gained confidence. 


2017 has been a year of succes for me mentally and most certainly physically , now 2018 is looking to be an even better year Im not quitting any time soon and have found the courage to finally finish school. 


And it's all thanks to you, this subreddit and this diet, to all the posts from all you beautifull people, I couldn't have done this without you. Thanks for existing and making this a better place ! Thanks to you I have finally been able to turn my life around.

—————————————————————————

—————————————————————————



* December 31, 2017: I made the New Years resolution that I was going to drop the weight. I was morbidly obese, had been overweight/obese my entire life, and I was done with it. I was going to do whatever it took to lose the weight.  
* January 30th, 2018: I was laying in bed, staring at my ceiling, and thinking “Well, it’s been one month. I haven’t done anything different. I’m still a lazy fat fuck, and I’ll be the same lazy fat fuck for 2018.” But after a few minutes, something clicked in my head.  Just because I let January go by didn’t mean that I had to give up for the whole year. I wasn’t sure how much weight someone could safely lose in 11 months, but I thought “fuck it, let’s just put in a solid effort and try.” 
* January 31, 2018: I fasted. 

I fasted for a couple days or so, drinking water and researching diets. I came to a few conclusions after putting in a tremendous amount of time reading NIH studies on diets and nutrition physiology: 

1. We’re eating too much sugar, in the modern Western world.
2. Everything I was taught in school about a food pyramid was completely horse shit.
3. There are many well-studied diets today, and all of them *probably* work if you actually stick to them and don’t cheat. 

I chose Keto.  I chose Keto because I was certain that I could stick to it without cheating. I’m the type of personality who can give up bread, sweets, fruit, pasta, and other carbs *if* I can have an extra serving (or two!) of bacon, sausage, steak, and ribs.

To make a long post short*er*... Keto worked for me. It worked for me so well that I was scared, and saw my doctor one month later. I had lost 1.0 lbs per day during the first month. He told me to eat when I was hungry, and to make sure that I was reaching my recommended daily amounts of micronutrients. Well I was already keeping myself stuffed. While I didn’t count calories, I was logging everything with MFP (free version). 

I was a little concerned about my micros/vitamins. After a little digging, I came across /r/KetoChow and /u/ChrisBair.  Keto Chow was the micronutrient “hack” that I was searching for. It works, it’s a great product, but I’m not here to shill for him.

I am here to speak to everyone who made the goal of losing the weight in 2019, and never took that next step: **It’s not too late.**

* Don’t wait to begin Keto tomorrow. 
* Don’t wait to begin Keto once you’ve finished the leftover pasta in the refrigerator. 
* Don’t wait to begin Keto until after the Super Bowl because you’ve already committed to bringing brownies for the office party.

If you wait to begin Keto, you’ll have an even better excuse next week than you do right now.  That’s just the way things go. There will *always* be a better excuse tomorrow. Always. There’s a great Chinese proverb, very widely known, “The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago. The second best time to plant a tree is right now.”

I’m *specifically* speaking to you right now. Plant your tree right now.  Not tomorrow, not next week, plant this tree *right now.* ",1

Just here to remind you guys that your small changes and losses add up over time. Try not to fixate on the daily fluctuations and imagine what you'll look like 6 months from now if you stay committed. Because whether it's keto or ANY diet, committing to it is how you get results. 

That is why I'm so vocal about making keto work for YOU. Dirty/strict/lazy/whatever, just conform it to YOUR lifestyle so you're able to commit to it long-term. Don't like to cook? I don't. Don't have time to work out? Me neither. But you can *still* achieve life-changing results by steering the course.

Imagine what your small monthly losses could add up to. For me, they've added up to being 120lbs lighter, improved bloodwork, no more snoring, clear complexion, tons of energy, and a more adventurous heart. 

I always tell myself that I've had 30+ years of eating like an asshole. I'll survive if I skip the fries for awhile.. and I promise you will too 😂",1

I gained 50 of the 80 I lost back and started going up and down the same 30 pounds for years. This January I had a bit of a wake up call. Decided I was going to get things together.

Where do I even start?  I'm a long time lurker, occasional poster here.  You guys are amazing, btw!  I was well on my way to 400 pounds a few years ago and binge eating my way into a deep depression. During this time, my husband and I had this beautiful wedding day and I felt so amazing until I got back our photos. I was so depressed at how big I was, I stepped on the scale and was blown away at what I saw.  I knew I was a big girl, but I didnt know I was THAT big.  After that moment and the feeling I had when I got the photos, I had my major wake up call.  I started Keto shortly after that and the rest is history!  Keto really helped me overcome my binge eating and take control of my life.  I have been keto for almost 2 years and just started weightlifting this past December. Weightlifting has helped me mentally to not focus on the scale as much. I'm losing inches and I feel so much stronger, so the number will catch up eventually.  You guys have motivated me more than you know and I love seeing everyone's progress to help me stay focused on my own goals.

I did little in the way of sports, only starting up to work out a bit during a seemingly endless plateau in early summer this year. I'm now aiming to build some muscle, and lose about 10 or 15 more kilos, to reach ""normal weight"" for my height.

154lbs down on my one-year ketoversary!,2505,dkrpq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/dkrpq5/154lbs_down_on_my_oneyear_ketoversary/,172,1571642764.0,"SW: 330(ish)lbs, CW: 176lbs, and the all-important [before and afters](https://imgur.com/a/6Hs9JjM) :)

Today marks exactly one year since I officially started this WOE, and I honestly never want to go back! Spoke a little about my story before, but the TL;DR version is: I've been yo-yo dieting since I was about eight years old, which was always going to be a recipe for disaster. Decided to try keto last year after finally leaving an incredibly toxic relationship, and it's helped me develop healthier eating habits and has just overall been so enjoyable!

Started off doing keto + IF, with an eating window between 12 pm and 8 pm, but quickly switched over to OMAD because I found I was just fuller for longer.

Obviously the scale victories have been amazing, but some NSV that I've had over the last year have been:

\- Fitting into clothes that I haven't been able to wear in a decade  
\- Being way, way more mobile than I've ever been before  
\- Finally being able to fly comfortably!  


My family/friends were skeptical at first, but now the results have convinced some of them to make the switch over to keto themselves. I've also developed a love for keto baking and cooking, and I feel like my relationship with food is slowly on the mend.  


I honestly can't thank this community enough for keeping me motivated! You're all the best <3",1

I'm finally back with a new set of before and after photos, and some insight into doing keto for 2 years.

[First off, the photos, because that's what we all care about the most, right?](https://imgur.com/gallery/MpGVyyR)

(Edit: [bonus face before and after](https://imgur.com/a/jNRNSm1))

My keto journey began on Feb 26, 2018. I had decided to start because I was finally tired of being miserable. I was ready to get back into the dating world, and found my opportunities limited. I was worried about dying young and leaving my small children without a father. And I was tired of always being tired. So, on Feb 25, I decided that the next morning I was starting keto. Then, the morning of Feb 26, I read that one of my heroes (Kevin Smith) had suffered a heart attack, and this really cemented my resolve to get my shit together. (Despite him going Vegan, I've very much enjoyed watching our parallel journeys on social media.)

The weight *melted* off at first. Two, three, or even four pounds per week! I found a rhythm and stuck to it. I was militant about what I could eat. After the first two weeks, after I kicked my sugar cravings, it became easy to tell my kids, ""no thank you"" when they would offer me a cookie or other sugary treat. (Slowly, I started reducing the amount of sugar they consumed as well; and while neither of them were at risk of obesity, I've taken pride in helping them build healthy habits so they don't end up where I was.)

Eventually I lost 100 pounds and felt *amazing*! I was suddenly attractive to the ladies, and was finding success with getting laid (though I'm still not having much luck in actual dating, but that has nothing to do with my looks). But, when I hit that huge milestone my motivation started to wane, and I was no longer as diligent about what I put in my mouth. I started having little bites of carb/sugar filled foods, and my sweet cravings started coming back. I started adding ""keto friendly"" treats into my diet, like the Quest protein cookies. I found that these, while fine for some people, were *not* fine for me; they held me back from continuing to lose because I would eat an entire box every day (which comes to 1000 calories and 16 net carbs!)  I would constantly go over my calories and carbs each day, and struggled to continue to lose. It took me months to drop another 45ish lbs, and I stayed there for a long time.

I was happy with where I was, and did not feel the *need* to lose more, but I was frustrated with my stall. Eventually I started kinda seeing a new lady, and I was feeling happier than I had in awhile. This lead to renewed motivation to track everything I ate *before* eating it, and paying attention to my calories and macros before I put food into my mouth. Then, coincidentally, I ran out of my morning Atkins shakes and had no money to buy more for over a week. Suddenly, without those extra calories and burst of sweetness on my tongue in the morning, I started losing weight again. I stopped craving as many snacks, and especially stopped craving the protein cookies (haven't had a protein cookie since Jan 1!)

Now, I eat around 1400 to 1800 calories per day, with about 70% of my calories from fat, and keep my net carbs around 0 to 6 per day. I'm again, like when I started keto, no longer hungry throughout the day, and my snacking has drastically reduced. I try to avoid sugar alcohols simply because they trigger sweet cravings for me, and I avoid ""carb replacement"" type meals, except on special occasions (had low carb waffles with my kids this morning).

At this point I still want to lose a few more pounds, but recognize that if I were to account for the weight my extra skin adds then I might already be at a healthy BMI. (For my height, a ""healthy"" BMI is 194 lbs or lower, and I've read extra skin can account for around 10 to 15 lbs... soooo, I'm not far off.)

I will continue to eat keto for life. And I thank everyone here for their support over the last two years! I couldn't have done this without this sub. You are all so inspirational, supportive, and informative! And I hope my journey can be that for someone at the beginning of theirs.

*Edit: Some additional thoughts based on what people are asking in comments...*

**Skin Removal Surgery**

Yes, I do plan to get skin removal surgery at some point. Originally I didn't plan to, because I saw it as a badge of my journey. A reminder of where I was, and how far I've come. But the reality is that when I look down at that bulge around my waist, I still feel fat, despite the evidence to the contrary. I read an article recently that mentioned of those who have lost over 100 lbs, the ones who had the skin removal surgery were much more likely to keep the weight off.

When I lift up and feel the extra skin, to me it seems as if there is still about 10 lbs of fat in there, so I'll keep going until that is gone. I've already requested a consultation for surgery, but it's been about a month and I haven't heard from them, so I don't think they got it... I'll have to call on Monday or something.

**What I Eat**

My daily food consists of about half a pound of bacon in the morning, and then a 1/3 pound hamburger patty for lunch, and another for dinner. I snack on string cheese, pork rinds, almonds, and other such stuff. I should eat more veggies, but don't often get them in.

For those eating on a budget, I hear you. I find that buying my bacon, hamburger patties, and string cheese from Costco to be the most cost effective way of eating keto. Keto is not cheap, but this makes it easier.

I also drink around 3 or 4 bottles of water per day, flavored with Mio. These are essential to my success. The flavoring makes it far easier for me to drink water, and it is pretty much the only thing I drink now. I keep unsweetened almond milk and chocolate almond milk in the fridge, but now that I don't drink the Atkins shakes (I used to add the almond milk to these for volume) I go through the almond milk far slower. It's mostly used for recipes now.

**Goal Weight**

My original goal weight was 225, because that was the lowest I had been in my adult life, and I knew it was obtainable. As the weight started melting off, I updated that to get below 200. I knew that would be difficult, but that I would feel damn good if I got there. Then, when I got to hang out with my brother last year (we live on opposite sides of the country) I saw his build and knew he was 165, and realized that I would probably look like that at about 185 based on my height, so I made that my stretch goal.

Now, at 210, I see my face and my shoulders, and my arms and my pelvic bone and I realize that I'm already skinny. But, as mentioned above, that loose skin around my waist obscures what I've accomplished. With the extra skin likely weighing around 10 to 15 pounds, I assume I would weigh under 200 with it removed, which tells me I'm basically at my goal weight now. It's hard to determine really how much further I would like to go while that's still hanging around.

**Exercise**

No, I do not exercise! At least not intentionally. Over the summer/fall I would go for a short hike with my kids about once every 2 or 3 weeks, which was quite fun! And I've found myself more physically active throughout my day simply because I can be. I don't go jogging or workout or anything like that, but I don't mind walking anymore, and I try to choose to do that whenever possible. I am more likely to have active play with my kids, and I do stuff like take them to the trampoline park when I can afford to do so. Before winter hit I would also ride my bike on very rare occasion because it's fun, and it always feels good when I make time for that.

But now that winter is here I've made less time for physical activity, and am getting a bit stir crazy for spring! I live in Vermont where we get about 5 months of winter, and I haven't branched out to the winter activities just yet...",1

Secondary Motivation

David Goggins - ""Cant Hurt Me"" Audio Book on Audible. 

**Diet**

I used an APP and tracked EVERYTHING for the first 3 months. Using Carb Manager i counted Cals and strictly adhered to Macros. Importing recipes was awesome for meal ideas. After 3 months i got the hang of it and stopped tracking which made things a lot easier. 3 meals was a lot at first. I was getting sick eating that much fat in the morning. I started eating 2 meals and more keto snacks and this worked well for the next 6 months. I meal prepped every weekend to keep on track. This is when I found Keto Ice Creams, Keto Breads Sauces and other staples to make the diet much more enjoyable. Prior it was just Meats, Veggies and fats the Last 3 months has been 1 meal per day with 2 or 3 snacks with one being a bullet proof coffee most days. The first 8 months i was still eating a good 2,000 calories a day. Now at the end I am still eating a good 1,300 to 1,500. This was a ramping down of Cals and Meals. 

**Exercise**

I WORK MY ASS OFF AND I LOVE IT!!! 3 to 5 days a week almost every week for the last year. Barring pulled muscles or being lazy, i would say there were several times I took a week or so break but always got back at it. I've done cardio and weight lifting this whole time. Workouts average 90 mins. I started on the recumbent Bike, I moved to the elliptical and now run on the treadmill. On Each Machine I progressively ramped up the miles or worked harder HIIT/Invervals. Weights I split muscle groups, Chest, Shoulders, Arms mostly upper body for the first half. Dumbells and Machines. About 8 Months in I weight 240 and started Boxing and incorporated Compound Lifts like deadlifts and squats. I also stopped skipping leg day and started lifting heavier. This was a ramping up of work through my journey in Cardio and in Weights and Lifts. 

**Fasting**

I started with the minimum IF window of 12 hours, then i did 14 hour fast 10 hour window, now 16/8. After 8 Months i weight about 240 and hit more walls. I've done 2 o 3 day water only fasts. Probably 4 or 5 2 day fasts. right now weight 215 and almost at goal i'll occasionally do OMAD or just skip an extra day if i'm lazy. Fasting really works well for me, my laziness actually helps here and its easy to get the energy from fats not eat and be good to go. Knowing your losing a bunch of weight. This was also a ramp. smaller fasts to begin with and increased longer fasts towards the end. 

**Help**

I used a nutritionist for a few months. She was a great help in learning how to read labels and the ins and outs of what I was eating. I started going to the Gym with a friend from work. a Good Gym buddy is a great help. I Inspired another Friend of mine and we started Boxing together. I went to the Doctors when I started, i got a physical including EKG to make sure i wouldn't have a hard attack at almost 400lbs doing cardio.  I absolutely cant wait to go back to get my next physical a little over a year later and almost at 200. 

**Cheats**

I've cheated 3 times where I ate carbs and sugar. My Birthday, Christmas and then one other insignificant time i cant remember. Each of these turned into 2 or 3 day ""screw its"" but It was worth it, kept me sane. I gained 10 pounds back and had big spikes. Not always easy to get right back into Ketosis. A good 3 day fast will help with this. 

**Conclusion**

I feel lucky, i did this with hard work and dedication but it almost feels like magic. I DID IT WITH KETO IF AND WORKING MY ASS OFF AT THE GYM. Other than that i am a little in disbelief. Everything i did was a Ramp. I ate more in the beginning, fasted less and My workouts got better and better. I didn't want to do it all at once, what would happen if i hit a plateau? I hit small ""walls"" and each time i would change something up. I attribute this ramping and constant changing of exercise, diet and fasting to never hitting a true plateau. I weight 215 right now and nothing will stop me from 194lbs!!! from there I plan to to put this whole thing in Reverse so to speak. I do plan to get off Keto, i dont want to give up carbs forever. I plan to Carb Cycle and continue to Lift Heavy. This is more of a Body Builder diet. I want to stay under 200 and hopefully build more muscle. I plan to decrease my IF and start eating 2 or 3 meals if i want a day. Although once i incorporate Carbs I think fasting, whether IF or extended will go a long weight to keeping me under 200.

A little while later I decided to check it out again and the first post stickied to the top of the sub was an invitation to sign up for the six week challenge that was starting the next day, April 12th 2017. Six weeks seemed doable so I signed up. My goal was to lose 14.6lbs in those six weeks (to go from 194.6lbs to 180lbs) with an ultimate goal weight of 135lbs.

When the final challenge weigh-in came around I had lost six pounds.

It was tempting to throw in the towel and say “Keto doesn’t work” and go back to my old WOE. But instead I looked back on those six weeks and asked myself if I could truthfully say that I had done everything possible and I couldn’t. I wasn’t drinking enough water, I wasn’t planning all of my meals, I wasn’t weighing all of my portions- I was half-assing things and expecting whole-ass results. 

So I signed up for the next challenge with the mindset of “I can do better.” I adjusted my expectations and set a new weight goal: 10lbs in six weeks. I ended up exceeding that goal by 3.8lbs and was thrilled. I kept it up for the next nine months or so- tracking everything, weighing everything, the whole nine yards.

Then I reached what became known to me as the 144 curse. On February 15th 2018 I made it to 144.6lbs and was officially 50lbs down. And then I bounced between 145 and 144 for the next **two months**. To say I was frustrated is an understatement. I couldn’t figure out how I could do better this time. I was tracking every partial ounce of food I ate and keeping up with my electrolytes and drinking enough water and doing IF even though I hated it and then, when I was staring down the pitiful macros of a 30% deficit, I asked myself if this was the life I wanted to live. Was losing the last 10lbs worth this much stress? The answer was no.

I decided at that moment I was done. Not done with keto, just done trying to lose weight. I figured that, ideally, weight loss will be a very short chapter in my life and I wanted to start eating how I want to eat for the rest of my life. I knew I didn’t want the rest of my life to be filled with measuring teaspoon~~s~~ of mayo onto my burgers or worrying about the fraction of a carb that’s in my garlic powder. I just wanted to eat the foods I knew would make my body feel good (meat, eggs, dairy, vegetables) in the quantities that would keep me satiated. So that’s what I did.

I stayed at 144 for another two months. Sometimes I considered going back to tracking but I never actually did it. I was happier this way even if it meant no weight loss. I weighed every week or so to make sure I was maintaining (I was) and then one week there was movement. Slowly but surely the number on the scale began to fall. 

• June 28th: 142.8lbs

• July 14th: 140.2lbs

• August 16th: 139.0lbs

• September 10th: 135.6lbs

18 months later I have finally reached the goal I initially thought I wanted to achieve. The number on the scale is nice, but being able to get there how I did feels like a much greater achievement. I learned that I can trust myself. I learned what actually matters to me (spoiler alert: it’s not my weight). I got to experience a truly satisfying and sustainable life even though part of me felt like I didn’t “deserve” it because I hadn’t made it to my goal.

The best part is that nothing changes now that I’ve reached my goal weight. I get to keep doing exactly what I’ve been doing and I couldn’t be happier about it!",1

Just wanted to share a progress report with everyone in case people are in need of motivation! I started my Keto journey on September 19th, 2020 (200 lbs), and today is October 13, 2020 (181 lbs). 

I started off with a 48 hour fast to go cold turkey on my food addiction, specifically carb addiction. I then started keto, and did intermittent fasting for around 2 weeks, with an 8 hour feeding window. I wasn't exactly strict about this though since I would have coffee with heavy cream in it in the morning. After a certain point I no longer really wanted food for most of the day so I went to one meal a day, generally at 5pm. I'm not calorie counting, but if I had to guess I was probably eating anywhere from 1500 - 2000 calories a day when I started keto, and I'm probably down to around 1000 nowadays? I just eat when I'm hungry and it's been working.

I've had a few cheat days, some of them filled with carbs. This is only when I am with my friends and family who don't really know about keto or don't understand. I don't want to be a bother, and it doesn't really set you back that much. For example I had a big bowl of spaghetti and meat balls this past weekend, and even though it did kick me out of ketosis and I gained some weight I don't regret the decision. That being said, keep cheat days few and far between, they're a slippery slope.

Started 5/21/18  at 320 lbs, and I’m down at 199.8. I want to hit 184 and have a “normal” BMI. 

I’ve been doing Keto, OMAD consistently for the last 4 months. Still track everything that goes in. 

Use Lost it! Premium for net carbs, and Zero to help track fasting, although I have quit using it recently. Now that OMAD is just a way of life, don’t need to track the hours as much. I eat between 5-7 pm, and that’s about it.  

Current calories are about 1200 a day, my meal is mostly a big protein (think steak, pork chops, chicken or fish) with a side of broccoli, cauliflower or green beans. Side almost always has cheese on it. Then cut up some strawberries, raspberries and blackberries with whipped cream if I want a dessert. 

I enjoy charcuterie and flackers during football games or if there is a dinner party. And the occasional enlightened ice cream bar (or two if I have the calories/carbs). 

Never really considered high fat as a need. I still have plenty of fat for my body to eat at 199.8(!!!). Tried a fat bomb once or twice, and I’ve done the fat head bread and rolls and such. I did like the pumpkin cheesecake at thanksgiving, but one piece was plenty. Took a “break” while on vacation, still OMAD, just didn’t track. Mostly knew what I could eat and stuck to it.

Wow I didn't expect that after my first progress post here around 2 years ago, that I would still be making them. If you want to see my full journey you can pretty much track it on my profile page through these posts. :)

I know I'll get a lot of questions about exactly what I ate and what I did, etc. but I've come to realize that moderation and not worrying about being perfect is the key, making it an actual lifestyle where you can continue to enjoy the food you love, just only around 20% of the time :P

During covid with no gym I've just made sure to keep moving every day, mainly doing hill runs and trail hikes.

Been so much support from Reddit during the journey, thanks for all the help to those who shared advice and just inspiration. ",1

Made the call from a hospital bed in Sept 2017 to change. Prior to that had the mindset that life worked around me.At that time I wasn't sure if I HAD time, I was slated to go to a care center to learn how to walk again after a severe back issue. Avoided that, and left on a walker with an oxygen machine,A year of diet later, I had slimmed down a chunk and got a spinal stimulator implanted which helped with pain - was able to get into the gym in January of this year - it's become a daily.

After a body scan a couple weeks ago, I realized that I hit goal. Loss of 215 lbs, and a body fat of 13%.  Intermittant fasting, Keto, and being stubborn absolutely saved my life.

Four years ago, I was also lifting weights and eating Paleo and with 23% body fat, looked the best I ever had.

One divorce, three moves, one remarraige, and one pregnancy later, I was miserable with my body, hadn't worked out in years, and ready to make a change.

My husband and I started keto two months ago. He works outdoors in a very physical job and calculating his macros was like doing advanced calculus. But regardless I was insistent that we do this the right way.

We both lost about 15 pounds the first month. After that he kept losing and I stalled. Even gained a few pounds. I knew I didn't want to drink less, so I ate less, and stayed stalled. I knew the drinking was the reason but didn't want to give it up. Spent every day wrestling with myself. Wanting to lose weight, knowing what I needed to do, and simply not doing it. I'd resist the urge to drink, then get bored or stressed and always find myself going to the liquor store.

This went on for a month before I got absolutely fed up with myself. I took a hard look at my habits, my goals. I realized that even if I was high functioning, I was developing a problem because it was so hard to quit. I realized I hadn't gone a day without alcohol in three months.

So I told my husband, because when he knows I'm struggling with something I feel more motivated to do the right thing for US. He said he was really proud of me for wanting to make a change and realizing that I wasn't happy with my habit. I told him I still would like to enjoy a drink on a date night, or share a bottle of wine with friends on the weekend, but I didn't want to drink on the weekdays or alone. 

So far I've been able to stick to that, and didn't drink over the weekend at all. I've had a few moments where I was upset and really wanted a drink, but got busy with something else instead. Since then I've only had one beer while out at dinner.

I also started working out. And while it's upsetting to struggle with ten pound curls when I used to use twenty, it still feels good to have sore muscles again.

The scale has gone down three pounds, up one, rinse repeat....

But I'm more excited about not feeling sick, being able to sleep through the night, regaining a sense of self control. I know I'll start seeing changes soon.

I was going towards a very dark place and I think going keto is what made me see it. My motivation to lose weight made me really evaluate what was more important. I suppose any other diet may have done the same but because keto is so effective from the very beginning, when I stalled I KNEW what was hindering my progress. It sure as hell wasn't what I was eating.

TL:dr- non scale victory in getting my shit together

Edit:
Came back to the internet with so many responses. I don't have time to reply to everyone but I've read every single comment.

1, thank you for all the support and encouragement. I feel even more motivated knowing that not only my husband, but dozens of wonderful anonymous people over the world, are in my corner and believe in me.

2, while I hope to one day be the kind of person who can drink socially or occasionally and be fine, I'm not there yet and intend to stay sober until I no longer feel like it's a fight to resist drinking. Right now my main focus is getting through each day without a drink and that's been getting easier Everytime I succeed.

3, if you're in the same boat, and finding that it's just too difficult to give up, it IS difficult but just like going keto, it gets easier with each day. There will be days you can't resist and days you want to punch a wall but the sub /r/stop drinking has a ton of helpful posts from what I have seen so far that help remind us of why we want to stop. If you can find a support or accountability buddy because I COULD NOT do this alone. 

4, I'm doing great but I'm not going to say ""yep, problem solved."" It sounds easy, like I just didn't drink one day and there you go... I'm not out of the woods yet and while I'm very motivated and determined, I know I cannot let my guard down. Thank you for the reminders to take it slow and treat alcohol like any other drug addiction.",1

I just wanted to share my joy this morning. 2 years ago my SO and I attended a wedding in her hometown. This past September we attended another wedding there and the difference is shocking to me. Shout out to everyone starting, doing, living Keto. This community is a big part of our success and seeing these types of pics was a great way to keep us going.

For anyone wondering, we eat Keto, but essentially “lazy Keto” (which I don’t really like the sound of, the way I eat isn’t lazy, but that’s for another post), both of us restrict carbs under 20 g a day. I incorporated IF and some 3 day fasts as well. Lots of burger and bacon. Admittedly it’s been pretty easy for me, I love this lifestyle. I’ve successfully coached several people through it, including my father, and everyone who committed has seen great results (he’s 66, went from 243lbs to 187lbs currently).

Happy Labour Day!  Today is a special milestone for me as it’s the 2-year anniversary of my weight loss journey.

**Results:**
September 5, 2016 starting weight: 350 lbs.
Goal 1: 300 lbs. Achieved February 5, 2017
Goal 2: 275 lbs. Achieved April 9, 2017
Goal 3: 250 lbs. Achieved July 16, 2017
Goal 4: 225 lbs. Achieved December 3, 2017
Goal 5: 200 lbs. Achieved June 10, 2018
Final Goal: 175 lbs.

Current weight: **182 lbs.**

The final goal was arbitrary.  Never been close to that in my life and never thought I would get close.  It represents half my starting body weight.  I will be adjusting my final goal to what I and my doctor (I should probably see one soon!) decide is healthy.  Thinking 160 or so.

Keep in mind that weight loss is not linear.  You will have ups and downs.  Over the period of two years I have averaged a 1.5 lb loss per week.  I weigh myself at the same time every Sunday morning and that's it.  My worst week was a 9 lb gain logged on Dec 31, 2017! My best losses were 6 lbs on May 13th and June 10th of this year.   

**Why did I start & keep going:**  This is the most important consideration for success in anything.  It is very personal and only about me now.  This is the only way I found I was not only able to start but be able to continue for the rest of my life.  I have tried and failed numerous times in the last 40 years. It’s because I never figured out the why.  Few, if any, will know what this is. I found mine, you find yours.

**How:** Lazy Ketogenic diet combined with Intermittent Fasting.

**A shout out or two:** I spent the last 2 years on this sub reading nearly every post and interacting from time to time.  I love you all!!! I'll stick around as I will **always** eat this way.

About a year ago I discovered Dr. Jason Fung online.  He opened my eyes to the science and ultimately intermittent fasting: [Dr Fung](https://idmprogram.com) Go to resources and watch the videos.  Read the blog posts.

I’d shout out some recipe guides, but there are dozens I use as you do.  Just Google ‘Keto recipes’.

I love this sub, it’s such a great place for support and advice, but I haven’t been very active for a while. Deciding to go Keto is one the best thing I’ve ever done and I would recommend it to anyone trying to lose weight. 

TLDR: 2 years of body transformation. 105 lbs down. Ate Keto for almost 1.5 years before incorporating carbs back into my diet around 7 months ago. Keto helped me change my relationship with food and I didn’t instantly get fat again when I ate a carb. I feel better than ever, and eat pizza sometimes now.

(Sorry the pics are the wrong way around!) 

This post might be a little bit different from a lot of ‘progress posts‘ on here. I started eating keto just over 2 years ago, I was morbidly obese and felt like shit all the time. 

I reached my goal weight in around a year before maintaining. I went back to eating carbs and a fairly ‘normal’ diet in November last year and have done a bit of a recomp since then, losing some more fat and gaining muscle. I don’t track my calories anymore, but I try to eat mostly whole foods and complex carbs and I am pretty active. 

One of the things I always see posted here is that people are hesitant to try Keto because they feel like they have to eat that way forever. 

I was really scared to go back to eating carbs. I thought I would instantly gain all of the weight I’d lost back. You can do Keto and use it as a weight loss tool, or you can use it as a life long way of eating, it’s completely up to you. 

I think one of the most powerful things that I’ve learnt during the last 2 years is that losing weight, being ‘healthier’ is SO more than just reaching a goal or number on the scale, it’s a lifelong journey and it takes constant work to maintain your weight and health. You can’t just go into this thinking you’re going to give up cake for 6 months and then go back to the way you used to eat and not gain the weight you lost back. 

The way I eat now is very different from the way I ate when I was heavier. 

You need to change your mindset and find a way you can eat for the rest of your life. My mentality around health and weight loss has changed a lot since starting keto and I think it’s important to work on other things than just the number on the scale to lose weight and keep it off. 

A lot of people tend to complicate weight loss. Everyone is looking for a quick fix, and if you go into a diet thinking that is what it is it’s what it will be. 

If you are in a calorie deficit you will lose weight. Keto helps with this because it decreases your hunger levels, but if it doesn’t work for you try something else until you find what does. 

You don’t need to do a juice cleanse or eat only eggs for a month. Make efforts to eat healthier, move more and be consistent. Celebrate the small wins, but don’t beat yourself up if you make mistakes, just keep going! 
If you asked me 2 years ago if I would feel and look the way I do right now, I would not believe you. I have lost weight, but I am more thankful for all of the things I’ve gained. Years of my life, better health, strength, fitness, confidence and a belief that I am capable of anything I put my mind to.

If you’re trying to lose weight just know that if I can do it, so can you. Don’t wait for the right time or next week. In 6 months you will be thanking yourself and wondering why you didn’t do it sooner. There will be shitty, hard days where you want to give up. Don’t! Keep going, its 1000% worth it to be the best and healthiest version of yourself you can be.",1
2 years Keto: 540-280 [Pics] [SV],1489,822i9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/822i9h/2_years_keto_540280_pics_sv/,102,1520243927.0,"I started Keto around this time 2016.  That 540 figure is an estimate, even a heavy duty scale was wholly inaccurate after lapping it's capacity by 100 lbs. 

Most of the weight was lost just by going keto, but I was never super strict at counting carbs or tracking macros (I tried it at first but hated it, there's a reason I never could do weight watchers).  For the most part it's just been eating with a keto mentality and knowing about where I was carb wise.  You know, you have that low carb tortilla now you can't have the Halo Top later, and vice versa.  

I started going to the gym about a month ago, before that it was all diet.  It's about a mile walk from work to the gym, I do another quick mile on the tradmil to warm up, do 2 sets on each weight machine, do 20 minutes on the elliptical and then it's another mile walk to home.  

Still have a ways to go, and frankly will probably have to have skin removed at some point (doubt I will be able to afford that anytime soon), but I'm like a new man.

We all have a different path. No matter if it's with a partner, weight loss coach, medical clinic, online support group, whatever your route to success, you are unique and will succeed when YOU put in the work for yourself.

There is no magic pill, and let's be real, if there was, most of us couldn't afford it. So let's rock on and keep losing while making gains in this silly little thing we call life.

2 years in...102lbs lost and never going back! [transformation pic],1903,fmzt7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/fmzt7v/2_years_in102lbs_lost_and_never_going_back/,111,1584911792.0,"This is my first time posting but I've been lurking here forever. Am I doing this imgur thing right?

I started keto a little more than 2 years ago after my best friend of 25 years started dropping weight so rapidly. At the time I weighed 287lbs and never met a dark beer I didn't like. I did a lot of research, found this sub, and went all in. I love to cook and really enjoyed trying out ketofied recipes and seeing that I didn't have to feel hungry all the time to lose weight. I completely changed my lifestyle and have never felt better. 

The greatest lesson I learned was that you have to keep going, even when the scale doesn't budge. I lost 85lbs the first year, then lost nothing for more than 7 months. I knew my body was still changing because I was still going down in sizes but not seeing my weight reflect the inches lost was frustrating. After reading everything ever posted on this sub about plateaus I kept going and eventually I broke my stall and made it to onederland, a place I haven't been to since high school. 

My original goal was to lose 100lbs, I don't think I believed I would ever get there but here I am down 102lbs. It's insane. My next goal is to get strong AF and maybe lose another 20lbs but really anything more I lose from here on out is an added bonus. I am so grateful for this sub for daily reminders that this lifestyle is sustainable even in times of uncertainty and chaos. I heart you all!

First of all, I was contemplating on whether or not I was going to share this. I was very nervous, and I didn't really think that there was any difference to my appearance before I did keto and after. It was only when I've come across a picture from June this year (a few weeks before I started Keto) that I've noticed how significant the changes were.

I used to eat so much food. I harked everything down my throat and never really thought twice about the way I looked because I was always chubby to begin with. I was already eating the amount for 4 people when I suddenly felt back pain. And it wasn't. Going. Away. My Ortho suggested I take medication for it, but strongly recommended that I lose some weight. My parents have been on keto for quite some time, and my mom even lost 60 pounds from it. Now her CW is 120 lbs and she's feeling better than ever. I decided to start last July.

My face definitely changed. I knew that, but I never really thought my body was also changing. I can now fit into old clothes I never used to wear from 6 years ago! I am so happy to be doing keto and definitely seeing the results in such a short span of time! I'm ready to be below the 200 category!!! I hope this inspires you to keep going and take the dive even when you feel like you won't make it!

May i started weight training and in June I started crossfit. I am currently at 165 lbs, I have put on 8lbs of muscle since my lowest weight.

Edit: thanks for the gold! No idea what to do with that but i appreciate it. :)) 

&#x200B;

First time posting here but thought i might share.. I honestly still can't believe this is real! As an overweight kid I never thought that I would actually find a way of eating that I could really stick to more than 2-3 weeks. I know it's a cliche story but just like any overweight person ever I literally tried everything and gave up soon afterwards. I kind of already made my peace with always being  the 'fat funny girl'.  5 months in I am not even tempted to stop. I know i am fairly new but I can already say that Keto changed my life to the better. Whatever i crave I can eat (yay for  keto versions of literally any recipe you can imagine!) but then again I am almost never craving anything. I really hope that this can be my way to get healthier and leaner in the future.

The reason I was trying Keto is fear of getting diabetes as many of my family members already got it. I started noticing some symptoms while still mostly eating carbs: a very dry mouth and aaaalways being thirsty. That was the last red flag I needed to get going. My blood sugar is fine now. :)

&#x200B;

Next milestone: get into the '70's' club kilo-wise

Next one after that: get into the 'normal weight' range for the very first time in my life. I can't even imagine this to be real but fu\*k, im getting close :)

I actually think I *gained* during lockdown because distance learning was just really...boozy.

Anyway, I finally stepped on a scale at my parents house this summer and almost fainted. I started keto the next morning, August 1, and today on October 9, I weighed in 25 pounds lighter. I’m so grateful I started when I did - I did very lazy keto after the baby before this one and worked out psychotically and only saw minimal results. This time I’m not exercising at all apart from walking and daily pt stretches. I’ve been about 90% “on”, taking occasional breaks for a fun meal or drinks on a weekend night. Recently I’ve started pushing breakfast to 1030 or 11 am and I’m seeing some new movement on the scale from that, I think.

I’ve always struggle w my weight and had a severe eating disorder in high school and college. I was tiny before our wedding - 135 - but ever since I’ve stared having babies my lowest weight hasn’t gone below 150. I started this journey at 259, I’m now at 235, and I’d like to end up around 165. I’m 5’5” and very muscular (when in shape) and just denser, I guess. Part of this journey has been working with a nutritionist for about a year and a half to unlearn decades of harmful behavior around food, and to be honest the intuitive eating work we did was definitely a contributing factor to how big I got. I don’t regret the work, but I do have a bit hole to dig out of.

I am careful with electrolytes and try to drink more water than I want. I’ve cut out all sugar and sugar subs except some Swerve here or there and a Diet Coke once or twice a month. I feel so much better, have more energy, my skin is super clear and my cycles have regulated completely. I was creeping into a size 20 after vacation over the summer, and yesterday I pulled on size 16 jeans. I’d like to lose another 70 lbs, but right now I’m just incredibly grateful that this is working, that my body isn’t actually “broken,” as I’d resigned myself to, and that I could actually lose close to 100 lbs by this time next year if I keep after it.

I’ve never used reddit before this past few weeks and I’m super grateful for this and the other keto communities and the diversity of body types and circumstances and results. Keep it up everybody! I keep replaying this line in my head, especially during harder weeks: “what if you didn’t give up this time?”

Almost done.,1448,8kwlnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/8kwlnz/250_248_down_almost_done/,73,1526889034.0,"So I like to post an update every time I hit a milestone in my weight loss journey. I started in 2016 and never thought I'd make it this far. As of last Thursday, I'm down 250 lbs. Starting weight was 545 and got down to 295 (gained 2 lbs back after a fun weekend at the river).

It's been such an intresting journey with ups, downs, stalls and everything in between but I know I'm the better for it.

I'm 6'2ish and I think if I can lose about 50 more pounds, I'll be super content.

So first picture was me about 3 wks in. Second picture is me today after realzing that I'm down another shirt size (2xlt) and spending my paycheck at Kohl's (damn you Kohl’s cash).

My advice to anyone that wants to lose weight, just start somewhere. Anywhere. If you have a bad day, week or even month, it's okay. As long as you don't give up. One day you'll look back and think, ""Holy shit, was that me? Why didn't I start sooner""

I wanted to share over here what I shared in another similar diet subreddit, because it was just as much your community and support system here that got me to where I am today!

**TLDR: Picture album at the bottom.**

Things start pretty fast if you are scheduled for a morning run. You get to the hospital and into the surgical pre-op staging room. Here you get to meet all the wonderful people like your nurses, assistant anesthesiologist, anesthesiologist, surgeon and more. Each of which you will end up forgetting. They ended up putting the IV in my foot, which I hear is rare, as they would be flipping me around like a short order cook making pancakes through the procedure. One of the final things that happened is my surgeon came along with his purple crayons and did some impressionistic art on me. Anyways, shortly after this I was wheeled away and honestly taken to what I assume was the surgical theater, after this photo was taken, I don't remember a thing that happened to me.

It's one of the most jarring things I can think of in life, coming out of a fog where you just feel lost and cheated of your time on earth. Before you open your eyes you can think of nothing but a void, no dreams or thoughts happened. To me, I just ceased to exist at this time. I was pretty out of it, but I remember my mom telling me that things didn't exactly go as planned. The surgeon said he wanted to do a perfect job, and to do so required him making the planned surgery go from 3.5 hours to 7. And in this time he took away 10lbs of skin, repaired my abdominal muscle wall (OWE), relocated my nipples, and gave me a brand new belly button. I later found out that scheduling was pretty upset at him because there was another procedure lined up after me. He ended up buying the nurses for me and the patient after a bunch of pizza to make up for the long hours!

Due to the time I had been out and under anesthesia, and the amount of work he did on me and took away from me, the doctor ordered that I remain overnight. Normally it's a same day surgery, unfortunately not for me. He was worried I'd have some severe pain as well as a lot of recovering to do from the trauma I incurred (thankfully, I only lost 1/2 unit of blood. How do they measure that by the way?). Next thing I remember from my brief moment of existence in the surgical recovery room was waking up in the main hospital. It was here I spent the next 20 or so hours where I thankfully had some of the best nurses looking after me. Here actually my main pain was from the gas that was building up inside my gut, and my inability of being able to use my abdominal muscles. I didn't care about the pain, they just plain would not respond to me! Also, after countless IV's and cups of water with out output on my end, they gave me an ultimatum. Pee in this hand held urinal sometime soon, or we are going to have to catheterize you. That got my body working it's #1 pipes again at least.

As nice as it is to be waited on and taken care of by professionals, I wanted out of that place. I despise IV's and the burning they leave in your hand, and the thought of the infection found there just gives me nightmares. Though, they did prepare a pretty solid clam chowder. While my blood pressure kept dropping on each vitals readings, it finally stabilized as long as I kept my compression binder on (within those first 24 hours I would very nearly pass out, get clammy, go def/blind if it got taken off). Walking a bit with the nurses and getting a brief checkup from the surgeon though I was finally discharged! The ride home was full of cursing each bump and pothole my wonderful city takes pains to maintain. But I made it, and into what ended up being the most wonderful recovery bed/recliner that I lived in for about three days.

Since then I've thankfully progressed enough to consider myself more or less independent and moved bad at my own apartment, just needing assistance here and there from my roommate. I'm surprised by the pain to be honest, if I'm not up and about I'm really quite comfortable if not for the er, well severe (medically worrying constipation), I'd be quite content. I thank my surgeon so much for his expertise and the techniques he says he uses to minimize the pain the patient feels after the ordeal. On my first week appointment with him my JP drains on three of my sites had discharge low enough for a removal, and I was ordered to get milk of magnesia and if that does not work, magnesium citrate for the constipation, they seemed worried about that (Thankfully MoM got stuff flowing again). I wanted to try out ibphrophin, and that actually seems to be doing the job instead of my hydro's and tramadol. After just one week of recovery, I feel like I might actually be able to make it through a day at my desk IT job!

I still feel like I am pulling my skin tight when I stand up straight, like I am wearing a bodysuit a size too small for me. But it'll stretch in time. Pain is there yes, but it's something I'm fighting through. And my compression binder is helping out. From what I understand, the scars themselves will be ugly and weak for up to six weeks, and the swelling and final body shape might take up to four-six moths to come together. But it made me cry. Finally, I am seeing a body of a person who I feel like was on the inside, and not some costume on the outside. There is a long way to go, and this does not mean I'm done, this journey is life long. But for now, it's a bit check in the win column.

I'd love to answer questions people might have about this whole process! It's a side of the story that not all choose to take, but those that do don't seem to see much support for.

TL;DR I’m so proud of me and just need to share. 

This is my third serious attempt at keto. A few years ago I successfully lost 55 pounds and kept it off for a while, but other poor habits (ie binge drinking) would knock me off track at least a handful of times a month. As an adult I’ve more or less eaten lazy keto as a default as a way to control my asthma (has anyone else found that carbs make it harder to breathe?), but always seemed to make an excuse somewhere along the line and end up packing on at least 5-10 pounds a year. 

When COVID hit, I took on the mentality of not caring what I ate, and it caught up quickly. About a month ago I completely committed to getting my act together after a doctors visit that left me in tears. I saw the number on the scale and thought “huh, not as bad as I thought” but then I caught myself. This is the most I’ve weighed in years, and if I kept on that path of 5-10 pounds gained per year then who knows where my health would end up. 

Since seriously committing, I’ve been able to say no to donuts in the break room, the fall treats my customers bring in, and I’ve stopped drinking beer and cider. I cook more at home than I have in a long time and I’m making more conscious decisions about what goes into my body. I’ve lost 13 pounds so far, and know that the majority is water weight, but that’s 13 less pounds than I was carrying around a month ago. I feel good and I’m so excited to see where this journey takes me. 

If you’re just starting, I’m proud of you. If you’ve lost your goal and you’re doing maintenance, I’m proud of you. If you’re recommitting, I’m proud of you. Keep on keeping on, y’all.",1

[Edited to add side view before and after](https://imgur.com/gallery/kYIjN0m) 

I’m a 5’5” female who is 35 years old.

Long story short, I started keto to reduce inflammation in my body. I had severe inflammation in my left eye that caused reduced vision and migraines for months. In addition I was experiencing depression, brain fog, and severe insomnia.

Since I’m self-employed and couldn’t work without my vision, I was feeling pretty hopeless.

On advice of a friend, I started keto on May 22, 2018 at 152 lbs. I hit my goal weight of 124 lbs by August, 2018.

I’ve since stuck with it and am happily maintaining at 124 lbs.

The best part? I’ve got my vision back!! The rest of my health issues have also dramatically improved, and I haven’t experienced severe insomnia since June. 

That said, keto changed my whole damn life.

I didn’t post/comment in here a lot along the way, but lurking and reading the posts here helped me keep calm and keto on. 

I just wanted to stop in to say thank you all for that.

I was a bit hesitant to share this because I still not completely where I want to be, but I figured since I met my first weight less goal I should share.

The first picture was taken 11/12/2018. I was not the heaviest I have ever been but I still hated how I looked. I was around 280 pounds. The after photo was taken today and I couldn't be happier!

I have always been athletic and played sports pretty much my whole life. When I went to college I had kinda gotten burned out of exercising because I had never done it for the love of exercising. It was always a means to an end for me. So as one would expect I gained a ton of weight my first three years of college. After hitting 300 lbs I finally decided to make a change. That change wasn't keto though. That wouldn't come for a few years. 

I started lifting and I saw some menial results, but I never really changed my diet. I got to about 280 lbs and stayed there. In re-finding lifting I had found powerlifting. It was a sport that didn't care what you looked like as long as you could push big weight, which I could. So I used that as an excuse to not diet.

Fast Forward a few years to 2018. My aunt, who lived in Texas invited my father and I do her wedding. Needless to say we would have to fly. My dad was a very overweight man and used that as fuel to lose weight. He and my mom (she needed to lose weight so she could get a knee surgery ) started Keto in December. I also started a low carb diet, not keto, and found some decent results. Lost about 20 lbs. from December to June. That is when I switched fully to keto and I will never look back! We went on our family vacation and I saw just how much both my parents had lost and I was sold. 

Kinda a long winded way to say keto has truly changed my life and just seeing posts in this reddit always picked me up when I was down and feeling like I needed a cheat. Thank you everyone for posting your progress pictures! They are truly motivating and I hope this post can do the same from someone else here.",1

I do have an appointment for one in March (6 months from last xray.)

3 Questions:

**1) Any experiences with the accuracy of Eufy scales?**

[https://www.eufylife.com/products/variant/smart-scale-p1/T9147021](https://www.eufylife.com/products/variant/smart-scale-p1/T9147021)

Ex:  Has anyone with a Eufy scale version ever had a Dexascan and compared the results for consistency?

I just saw something really odd happen in my Eufy scale readings that make me not feel I can trust it.

[https://imgur.com/n0owgWF](https://imgur.com/n0owgWF)

I can't believe that I lost 3 lbs of bone and 15 lbs of muscle in 4 days.I realize home scales are not **accurate** compared to something like a Dexascan.However, up until that day, it was at least **consistent**:

Before that day, the % readings were very consistent around the **higher** bone / muscle numbersSince that day, the % readings have been very consistent around the **lower** bone / muscle numbers.

I am losing 1.5 - 2.0 lbs / week, thanks to reading all the tips and stories here.

Am using the KetoGains Novice Strength training program with dumbbells 3 x / week Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday (football nights!)[https://www.ketogains.com/2015/09/ketogains-novice-kettlebell-workout/](https://www.ketogains.com/2015/09/ketogains-novice-kettlebell-workout/)It is not easy, even at the light weights I'm (femalle) using.  But watching Drew Brees and Tom Brady at 40+  do amazing things is very motivating to really push it.   Plus, 4 sets of 12 reps  x 6 exercises is over quickly during a football game (definitely < 45 min).

**2) Any ideas what else could have caused the % changes?**

&#x200B;

**3)** Black Friday is coming up.  I was thinking about getting one of the higher end Tanitas(or another more accurate scale with **4 leads** with some FSA $ I still need to use up.

**Any experience with Tanitas?**

I probably would have bought one already but it's so annoying they don't sync with Apple Healthkit.

I have dramatically increased my exercise this month, on average 2 hours a day of running, cycling, hiking or weights. This is around double what I did in September and I feel great for it. Today I did a grueling 50 mile off-road bike ride - I haven’t been able to do that for 20 years.

30 Days. Challenge completed. Here’s my thoughts.,2,e3a1lc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/e3a1lc/30_days_challenge_completed_heres_my_thoughts/,2,1575032647.0,"So over a month ago my hubby and I went on a little journey. We both went WFPB. We are done with the challenge. And this is where we are. 

SO wanted to do the change for health reasons. He’s 32, like me. 160ish pounds. 6’1”. But even given his leanness, he has some heart issues. Inflammation. Also extreme stress induced and social anxiety. I’m 5’6” and 120lbs. I work out a bit and overall good health. He wanted to see if it could help his depression and tiredness, and heart problems. I wanted to see if it could help with my strength building. 

I spent 30 days making every meal we ate. Breakfasts. Every lunch. Every dinner. Every snack. Instead of chips, we ate toasted pumpkin seeds and lentils. Our only cheats was subbing fake meat for taco nights.

1) SO says he feels so much better. He actually started working out when he comes home from work sometimes. He says he’s happier. Anecdotally, I find his mood more tolerable. I enjoy his company more. He doesn’t talk about how bad something is, but brings up what he liked. 

2) He is better company. We went out to dinner with my BFF after having a baby. We shared a couple plates of food like baked falafel tacos and lentil salad. He normally shies away in convo but he was animated. We came home and he didn’t go right to bed. He said he didn’t feel drained like after having a steak 

3) he enjoys lunch more. He says lunch feels like he’s nourishing himself. 

4) he doesn’t have a huge interest in eating meat.  He says he misses the ease of choosing a place to eat and options. He said that he will probably have a bit of seafood. But for the most part he’s going to stay 90% vegetarian. But I make all the food anyway. So whatever I make. 

Now me. 

1) to be honest. I already ate better than he did. Before he would heat up canned food for lunch and I have a microwave so I took leftovers. Plus my work had healthy catering 50% of the days. 

2) I had terrible digestive issues. I needed enzymes. I needed probiotics. I am still bloated a lot of the time a month after. 

3) making meals. Meal prepping lunch. Creating snacks. It’s fucking tiring. 

4) I lost muscle mass. I increased my calorie input by 20% to balance out the protein intake with carbs but it wasn’t enough. I literally also can’t eat anymore. 

5) post gym recovery was a bit easier. But also harder because I couldn’t gain. I had to deload weights. I felt better. Performed worse. 

6) I enjoyed creating new foods. I don’t miss meat. I don’t have cravings for beef or chicken. I don’t want to eat flesh for nutrients. But I don’t need a blood test to know I’m not absorbing what I did before. 

So final thoughts:

I enjoy this community. But I’m going to live by the words the CFO of where I work told me. This isn’t supposed to be a punishment. 

We haven’t eaten meat yet. But I think I’m going to probably move to flexitarian, whole foods based.  Probably use egg or other protein after a work out. 

I am thankful for this challenge to help me make better choices (ie making awesome help heart coco balls instead of cookies), and learning how to use lentils and other dishes. How to use less, or no oil. I’m thankful for the support of the community while I ventured through it.

I tore my meniscus, and with quarantine, any attempt at establishing a gym or exercise routine crumbled. I ordered in a lot. Barely moved. And was drinking a lot at home to make up for not going out. 

In early September, I made a determined effort to break this cycle. I stepped on a scale and saw 328. A weight I’ve never seen. I knew I put on some weight, but I was off by about 30lbs from what I thought I was. It shook me!

On September 7th, I turned to Keto. I lost 55lbs on it a couple years ago, so knew the plan. But have been more determined more than ever.

Happy to say that 30 days after starting, I am nearly 15lbs down! And I’m 30 days sober to go along with that!

I want to thank everyone on this subreddit. Every time I was discouraged or wanted to uber a pizza, I read your stories and read the wiki to motivate me. You guys and the Keto Manager app have helped me get back on track!",1

It has been two weeks of eating WFPB and I am sold. The environmental waste I was contributing to started weighing me down, and I had to make the switch.

I am female and weigh over 300lbs. (Worth noting that I am 5'10"" and broad as well. I was pretty skinny and muscular at 200lbs) My biggest problem has always been binge eating and portion control. Someone on here said that WFPB allows them to live in harmony with their binge eating disorder and food addiction. I am finding that to be true.

All my life I have counted calories on and off. Lost and gained weight over and over. At 27 years old I have to admit that its not working and try something new. I love to cook and like almost all foods (my problem lol) so it shouldn't be too difficult I hope.

I have started an instagram food diary. Its not cute or whatever but it has been helpful. It's called '[rivercityrabbit](https://www.instagram.com/rivercityrabbit/)' and I'd welcome your accountability. I am not perfect and have made mistakes already but I will get better.

Edit: thank you guys SO much for your support, advice, and Instagram follows! I am more motivated than ever. I’ll have you know that I haven’t lied once about what’s on my Instagram and will not. It’s just a brutally honest look at what I eat. I’m already thinking differently about the choices I’m making knowing y’all will see it on Instagram that night or the next morning. 🙈

It's so unreal to be making this post right now, even though I'm not yet at my goal, I feel fantastic and I wanted to thank you all! I'd never been able to stick to a diet for more than a day -- I'm not kidding. I initially found Keto through a beautyguru I watch on YouTube, RawBeautyKristy, and I thought -- hey, I can do that! I did many many weeks of research, (thank you Dr. Berg and KetoConnect) and read posts from r/keto and r/xxketo like it was the bible. 

I started this journey in the beginning of my second semester of my Junior year in college, utterly miserable. I went up a pants size every year, from a 2 in freshman year of high school, to a 12. I looked swollen, and unhealthy, and it was starting to take a toll on my mental health. I was having feelings of anxiety and depression -- issues that have never plagued me ever before, as I am the most social person I knew. I needed a change. 

In the beginning of January, I left for Switzerland for the semester (pics are from the night before I left for abroad). There I tried to cut out carbs when I was on campus, but indulged when I went on trips. I practiced IF and walked everywhere. These practices carried over to when I returned home in June. I have done hard core Keto since, and I have never felt so healthy, positive, calm yet energetic. I am fitting into clothes I haven't worn in 5 years, and the feeling is indescribable. 

I know my weight loss story is not as dramatic as many of the ones on this sub -- and I applaud you all. Thank you a million times over for the posts, pictures and candid comments. You don't understand how much it can mean to someone. See you all in 15 pounds at my goal!!

Best wishes,

Anyway, reflecting on a year and 4.5 months of Keto! It’s been amazing! I’ve never gone over 20 net carbs, no cheats, just Keto lifestyle and exercise! I don’t plan to go back. I don’t miss carbs. I don’t feel different, but I know I look different! If you’re thinking about getting started, do it. Stick with it. I’ve been obese my entire life and this was what did it, and it was easy. I’m not kidding. Keto is amazing. Take pics, take measurements, have goal outfits, get it done. If I can, you can. Although I was lucky enough to have a hubby that cooks :P

I am excited to hit a normal BMI this year (even though BMI is dumb lol), get to my goal weight (whatever it ends up being), and gain more muscles!

Today is 1 full year of Keto for me. 1 full year of finally  seeing years and years of struggling with my weight, pay off. 1 full year of realizations that everything I was taught to manage my weight and Thyroid were wrong (for me anyways). 1 full year of feeling like I am in charge of my own body.

This 1 year has taught me that losing weight will not magically fix my body confidence issues...but in some instances, just change the things I'm self concious of. It has also taught me that losing weight wont stop other people from making back handed compliments.

But...this one year has most importantly taught me that I am the one in control of my health and that this is the way I plan to continue eating.

110 pounds in 12 months....cant wait to see what the next 365 days brings....

I’ve dropped 110 LBS using a mixture of keto, fasting, and counting calories. It probably took me about 10 months all together with plenty of falls of the wagon. Biggest motivation for me was going through a divorce, being a nurse and realizing it was hard to push the importance of healthier living on my patients when I myself was morbidly obese and lastly just wanting to be able to spend more time with my family later on in life instead of dying young. 

I’ve since gained about 30 lbs back after fracturing my back and having back surgery about 6 months ago but I’m back on the train and already down about 17 pounds in the last month or so. 

As well as changing my eating my success was also helped along with lifting regularly and training Brazilian jiu jitsu. Posting this so that maybe I can offer some encouragement for others as well as some accountability/motivation for myself.",1

Is this normal?

10/14/2020 Update: it was CBD! For whatever reason, being on keto makes me super sensitive the CBD with full spectrum cannabis extract I take. I used to take 50mg 2x daily for nerve pain. I never felt dizzy or sleepy. Now, for whatever reason, 50mg once knocks me on my ass for about four hours. I now take 10mg 2x daily and it still works better than before.",1

I started very strong, losing the majority of my weight in the first few months, getting down to about 190lbs. Up until August 2020, I was mainly just doing maintenance Keto, with the occasional cheat meal. But my weight was slowly creeping back up, I finally got over 205lbs in July, and realized I needed to do something about it.   
  
So that, combined with other events in my life (that’s a whole other story), I found my motivation again. I’ve lost about 25lbs in the last couple months, and am aiming to lose another 20lbs in fat. I have been doing a combination of Keto with IF and Yoga workouts on YouTube. All in all, I went from size 44 waist down to a size 33, and XXL shirts to M!

The burrito wrap is processed as well I guess. 

I’m not going super hardcore on reducing fat yet. Switching from keto I’m probably eating 1/4 of the fat as previously was before but I am going with plant based fats, avocados, coconut and olive oil, and nuts. 

Snacks are fruits, nuts, and pickles. Having very minor stomach issues. I’m sure my microbiome is wondering wtf is going on because there aren’t getting their daily feeding of steak and eggs and chicken wings. Reading the science on that is what has me the most excited about this.

I am a (quite overweight) 24 year old woman, and I've been doing keto for 4 weeks and feeling great! 

My only issue is that it seems like my weight loss has stalled. The first two weeks and a bit were great, I lost 15 pounds and was feeling super motivated, but the last two weeks I've been at a standstill. I'm being strict with my keto, drinking lots of water but just not sure what's wrong? 

I know 15 pounds in a month is still good, but I have a LOT to lose. I started at 315.6 and am at 299.4, so it's not like I'm on the more slender end of things. 

I guess overall I was just wondering if any of you had any tips, or similar experiences? While I love being healthier to my body, and I'm feeling really good, it's hard to keep my motivation quite as high when the scale isn't moving.

I started in September 2019 at 298 lbs. I’m currently at 258 lbs. With the help of my wife, her adventurous and experimental cooking practices, we are both showing losses. Maintaining 20grams or less daily carbs, this is working for me. Sometimes it is tough, maybe 25grams, and sometimes I completely go off the rails with 50grams or more, but I get right back to it the next day. I love craft beers, and we have frequent social gatherings where a few cocktails are in order. I’ve learned to enjoy a good dirty vodka martini instead of pounding IPA’s with my boys! I’m a heavy lurker here, and I can not tell you how thankful I am for the inspiration I draw from all of the stories on this sub!

This journey started as a challenge involving family. Four of us are all losing weight to a predetermined goal (or beyond). With each week that passes, each of us transfer $25 into our savings accounts. After one year, if our goal has been met, the inceptor has planned a “company match” of the amount we have deposited ($1300). The result will be four of us all feeling much healthier and taking a return trip to London together... we’ve named our challenge “Postcards from London”.

I look forward to reading more of your stories, and keeping this lifestyle as a permanent change! Cheers! See you in London!",1

Not this year.  With just over two months to go I'm still losing, down 41 pounds and counting.

My first time I was really successful, but a trip to Sicily to visit family (who won’t accept no as an answer to ‘mangia’) really derailed me I just absolutely went overboard at every meal.  My 2nd time I didn’t do it strictly and wasn’t really into it and looking back I probably went over on carbs a lot which is why it didn’t work so well.  This third time I started May 22nd of this year.  I’m a nurse in New York and March and April were so depressing.  We were constantly being sent lunch every day and I would drink a bottle of wine on my days off just to forget about how depressed I was.  

Starting in May I walk every single day I’m off.  I was averaging about 9-11 miles a day in June/July but now I do about 5 miles a day.  I’m down 37 pounds.  I’m so happy hunger and hypoglycemia no longer dictate my life.  I haven’t cheated once.  Every time I felt I wanted to cheat I just found a low carb alternative to whatever it was I wanted to eat.  I made a low carb birthday cake on my birthday.  I never feel deprived of anything.  I still have a little ways to go and I want to start working on building muscle as well, but overall I’m super happy with my progress!

So I'm actually posting for a friend.  we both started keto at the same time about 5 weeks ago. My male friend has been having a hard time with it. We've both been keeping carbs under 20 and also keeping track of our other macros using the calculator in the faqs.I'm trying to figure out what might be causing him to not lose weight.

 I don't want him to get frustrated and stop the diet because I really think that it's a good step forward. one thing that I've seen in here and that he has started doing is measuring because I know you don't always necessarily see weight loss on the scale but you might see it in inches. 

would anybody be willing to offer some guidance on some other things to try or reasons why he might not be losing weight? Or similar experiences others have had? Thank you so much!",1

I dropped ten pounds very quickly but stalled out.  I did a lot more research and after decided to do intermittent fasting as well as really starting to monitor what I ate instead of just freelancing it . It turned out I was over consuming keto foods, snacking quite a bit and that was stalling my weigh loss, even reversing it to a degree.

So I got myself on a more regimented program.  I generally eat a large meal around 1PM  then a small snack at 5PM. The rest of the time is a fasting window for me. This sounds hard but it actually isn't if you eat the right foods and it takes a while to get used to.

Anyway this really boosted results. And I am clearly not where I want to be body-fat wise but I feel that I am really turning the corner now.  My goal is to get my body-fat to around 20% (currently 24% and my all time high was 27% in June of 2018). My weight, I am not that concerned about but I have dropped from a high of 227 to 200. I really do not want to weigh much less than 200.  I am focused more on body composition.

I am 50. So my needs and metabolism are different than younger people. I think the challenges are a bit more daunting due to slower metabolism and years of yo yo dieting.  But I am healing my body and getting it all back on track.  My wife and I are on this together, and that helps. She has lost more than 25 ponds.  Maybe one day she will post.

50 years ago The sugar industry paid off scientist to point blame on fat. (Article in text),5054,8dfaaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/8dfaaz/50_years_ago_the_sugar_industry_paid_off/,355,1524178903.0,"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/13/493739074/50-years-ago-sugar-industry-quietly-paid-scientists-to-point-blame-at-fat?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=food

In the 1960s, the sugar industry funded research that downplayed the risks of sugar and highlighted the hazards of fat, according to a newly published article in JAMA Internal Medicine.

The article draws on internal documents to show that an industry group called the Sugar Research Foundation wanted to ""refute"" concerns about sugar's possible role in heart disease. The SRF then sponsored research by Harvard scientists that did just that. The result was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1967, with no disclosure of the sugar industry funding.

The sugar-funded project in question was a literature review, examining a variety of studies and experiments. It suggested there were major problems with all the studies that implicated sugar, and concluded that cutting fat out of American diets was the best way to address coronary heart disease.

The authors of the new article say that for the past five decades, the sugar industry has been attempting to influence the scientific debate over the relative risks of sugar and fat.

""It was a very smart thing the sugar industry did, because review papers, especially if you get them published in a very prominent journal, tend to shape the overall scientific discussion,"" co-author Stanton Glantz told The New York Times.

50lb weight loss!,1674,gro4pw,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/gro4pw/50lb_weight_loss/,200,1590629330.0,"https://imgur.com/gallery/enSnOpp

2014 was a really mixed year for me. A death, a birth, a house move, stopping smoking. Anyway, the upshot of that year was a gain of about fifty pounds for me. 

Starting weight of 75.5kg (166.4lbs) down to 53kg (116.8lbs) at a petite height of 5 foot 2. 

I had a lightbulb moment when walking past a shop window in 2019. I caught sight of my reflection and started the usual thoughts, ‘God, I wish I were slim again. I’d give anything to be back to my old size.’ Only this time, a snide little voice in my brain replied ‘Yeah, you’d give anything except six months of diet and exercise.’

I don’t know why, but the lightbulb flashed into blinding, beautiful light and it really kicked me in the arse. In a good way. I started Keto the next day and got my backside out walking every day. I keep my net carbs under twenty grams and walk between three and twelve kilometres a day. I eat my low carb veggies and as I’ve become closer and closer to goal weight I’ve had to focus more on the calories. It hasn’t been easy every single day, but it’s been so much better than it had any right to be.

Thanks to the weight loss my plantar fasciitis has vanished, my femoral bursitis has improved dramatically and frankly, I feel so much better in my body. More energy, faster movement, better stamina.

If you’re still sitting on the fence about Keto then know that you can start any day now and it will be the best decision you make this year. This subreddit has been an epic place to lurk and watch other people’s success and keep my head in the game. Thanks guys.",1

Hello Everyone, I started keto back in August 2020 and as of today I am officially down 50lbs. To be honest, I don’t think I knew this was possible. I’ve never had this kind of weight loss in my life, roughly 35lbs in to my weight loss I plateaued and went threw a rough patch, I had cheat meals which led to a week out of keto and eating unhealthy and gained back 6lbs. That was enough for me to give my head a shake and get back on track. It’s okay to fall off sometimes, just get back to it! 

Now over the last 3 weeks I’ve started running daily and achieved my first 5km run. 

I just wanna say, this is amazing and it’s not easy all the time. If your truly committed, success will come your way.

I'm emotional for so many reasons. I've almost hit an 80lbs loss, and I have finally found love with myself and my body. I have learned so much about myself in the last 51 weeks and I have learned so many ways to continue to succeed.

\#1: Don't give yourself an excuse to slip. ""I had a long day"" or ""it's my friend's friend's 21st""-->DOESN'T MATTER. Long term success means planning ahead and always making the best choice. I'm in college, and there have been days I struggle when I'm stuck on campus and need food. But I make do, even if it's not as easy as grabbing chips. Put your health before immediate gratification. 

\#2: Your diet will evolve, and you should try new things. Feels like I have tried just about every variation of keto. Zero carb, carnivore, IF, OMAD. Just keep adjusting, keeps the diet fun!

\#3: I am a recovering sugar addict. At the end of the day, my number one enemy is sugar. I will avoid this as all costs. I treat this a if I'm a recovering alcoholic, because honestly it really was that bad in my life. It's all or nothing on this one, and if you struggle with a sugar addiction like me, cut it out. For my birthday I want a nice steak with garlic butter.. not cake

\#4: Boys flirt with me now, I love that. 

\#5: DON'T BUY NEW CLOTHES ALONG THE WAY. Go thrifting. Let's just say I  have donated quite a bit to the local community

\#6: You'll mess up, unless your a machine

\#7: Start lifting, trust me

\#8: KEEP IT SIMPLE. Forget the ""keto hacks"" and ""starbucks keto drinks."" Eat whole foods, and focus on protein and healthy fats. There's no reason to rely on keto bread, which honestly isn't all that impressive (especially when you could eat a big yummy steak instead)

\#9: When people say ""oh I couldn't live without carbs, how could you give up pasta"" I now think ""I couldn't like without fats, who needs pasta""--> super weird how your cravings change

I started keto one year ago at my highest weight- 184lbs as a 5'3"" 29 year old woman. I was obese and after years of yo-yo dieting of only a few lbs here and there, I thought I'd never lose the weight and was doomed to be fat forever. Then I found keto and this sub, saw all the awesome before and after pictures, and decided that I needed to make a change NOW. The hardest part of changing to a keto lifestyle was definitely the first month, but now I can't imagine living any other way. One year later, and I'm down 52 lbs, and back to a normal BMI for the first time since I was a teenager. I've still got some more to go, but I think I've got it down enough to share a bit of what I've picked up in the past year.

&#x200B;

Things I've learned after a year eating keto-

1. IT GETS EASIER OVER TIME! Your tastes will change. Get through the first two weeks to a month and you will be cruising. You're going through sugar withdrawal like a carb addict and if you give in then you're going to set yourself back. Now that I've been eating this way for so long, I can taste the tiniest bit of sugar in things and it is totally unappealing to me.
2. Weigh your ingredients and portions! You think you know what an oz looks like!? YOU DON'T. When I first broke out my food scale I was SHOCKED at how much I was overeating. No wonder I was obese, I was eating 3 serving sizes when I thought I was having one! If you don't have a kitchen scale, get one and use it. You still have to count calories if you want to lose weight on keto. And recalculate your calorie intake after every 10lbs because you're going to have to eat less as you weigh less. I track everything in my fitbit and myfitnesspal apps.
3. Learn what replacements to make and get in your diet. I was and still am a big baker. I found that Lakanto Monkfruit sweetener is the best tasting and I can still enjoy sweets as long as I make them. Pork rinds instead of potato chips and crush them up as a ""breading"" for other dishes. Cooking is going to be your new hobby so get good at it.
4. Everyone will ask you how you lost the weight and then look at you like you have 3 heads when you say you stopped eating sugar and carbs and count calories. I still tell people how I do it but at the end of the day they have to make the decision for themselves to change their diet.
5. You'll lose the most weight in the beginning, then it's a grind to lose the rest, and you'll lose slower as you get to a normal BMI. I started out losing around 2lbs/week and now it's slowed down to around .6lbs/week now that I'm at a normal BMI. Weight loss isn't linear, but it should be a downward trend. I weigh more/stall during ovulation and premenstruation, but it all evens out over time. I've never ""plateaued"" for more than 3 weeks and I think it's because I am strict with tracking calories. Whooshes are real too.
6. Body dysmorphia is a thing. I didn't think I was THAT fat at my highest weight, and some days recently I feel just as fat as when I started. Take before/after pictures so you can remind yourself where you started.
7. Sticking to it is about DISCIPLINE- not motivation. Throw motivation out the window, it's a trap and fleeting. You don't eat more than 20g net carbs per day, you count your calories, and that's the end of the story. You don't need motivation to stick to the plan, you need to just do it. Don't make excuses for yourself to eat like shit, and don't lie to yourself about what you ate. It'll get easier as you become more disciplined.

I've recently started participating in r/52weeksofcooking and r/52weeksofbaking and I'm finding it a lot of fun. I thought it would be nice to have a vegan version of 52 weeks of cooking! So every week there's a new theme and we cook something which relates to the theme: for example Japanese, tomatoes, family favourites etc.

I had a look and there was a subreddit like this made about 6 years ago but it's dead now, so I made my own. It's called r/52weeksofvegan

If anyone here is interested please feel free to check it out and hopefully we can get something good going! Personally I love cooking and so I'm really excited about it. I love the other subreddits but I'm not a huge fan of having meat on my feed so fingers crossed this will work :)

Also this is my first time running a subreddit so if anyone has any tips please let me know! I could use the feedback",0

I let my weight and self image fall to the side because I my self worth was pretty low and it just didn't matter to me how I looked.

Well, the morning of the 29th, after having a pretty terrible dinner, I decided to do keto cold turkey and haven't looked back since. OUT of nowhere, I developed extreme will that i never had before in my life. Its been 103 days and I have yet to ""cheat"". I never skip a workout.

Today, I stepped on the scale and saw 212lbs, a number I haven't seen since 2012. I never set a goal weight so that I wouldn't have a ""finish line"" and lose motivation. At this point, I'm looking at keto as a lifestyle instead of a diet. To me, onderland is a nice milestone, but it won't be where I stop.

Just wanted to make this post for anyone who was like me and is lurking in this sub seeking motivation. It took me ~3 months to erase ~8 years of weight. When I think about it like that, I can't help but stay committed to keto.

[Before and After](https://imgur.com/a/vbUxCW5)

I'm so excited to share my story with you! But, first I want to express my sincere gratitude to this subreddit and to all of your brave and amazing success stories, they are highly motivating and kept me focused on this WOE!  Also a huge shout out to the Lovely and Feisty Keto Bitches over at r/xxketo4U2 who keep me entertained, and accountable in my quest for Health!  I live there on a Daily basis getting my dose of support and reality!

I started out on my Keto Journey on April 1, 2018 weighing 303 lbs.  I am currently in the low 190's, my lowest weight being 191.6 lbs in the last couple weeks but right now I'm loving being solidly in Onederland, a place I have not visited in over 20 years!   I went from a Size 24 to a size 12/14!   My goal is to get down to 175-180 lbs.  In the beginning I was losing 10 lbs a month like clockwork and now it has slowed to 2-4 lbs a month and I'm just fine with that! 

When I first started Keto, I logged everything in Carb Manager the first 6 months, but now I focus mostly on just eating whole Keto foods and keeping my net carbs under 20g. Occasionally, I will go back to tracking and logging to sharpen the saw.  I love to cook so this has made food prep and variety very pleasant.  I eat mostly grilled meats, eggs, cheese, avocado, bacon, sausages, canned tuna, and vegetables like broccoli, brussels, swiss chard, green beans, red bells and mushrooms.  I have never made things like Mug Cakes or Fathead Pizza, not because they don't look tasty AF in all your photos but because for me they represent a slippery slope.  I was never a sweets eater anyway, but I did consume more than my fair share of Pasta, Potatoes and Rice dishes pre-Keto. I could put the hurt on a Chinese Buffet.   I do love to make Cauliflower Risotto or Mash to provide a ""comfort food"" feel to things like Cracklin' Chicken or a Green Chile Braised Beef Brisket.  I have never been bored with Keto Foods! I don't do cheat days and I've never fallen off the wagon. But if I did, I would just KCKO.

After a couple months on Keto, I noticed my appetite dropping to the point that I no longer wanted a lunchtime meal.  This is when I started playing around with just two meals a day and IF.  Typically, I will have my first and largest meal at 10 am and then a smaller meal around 5 or 6 pm.   I also regularly consume Alcohol and my drink of choice is a Gin Snack.....Gin with Lime LaCroix and a squeeze of Lemon.

After about three months, my energy levels surged so much that I started swimming laps in my community pool and worked my way up to about 1200 yards most days of the week just doing slow laps.  Then I started doing some hiking in our beautiful Southern Arizona Canyons and hiking is now my ""thing"" getting in upwards of 30 and sometimes 40 miles a week.  I love particularly hilly and challenging terrain!  I also Volunteer at a local Hospital and get in lots of steps.  I try to ""move"" all the time.  I also credit my physical activity with Recomp Benefits because at my age, I have never had an ass or thighs this small, even with previous weight loss endeavors.  I am also pleased with the lack of loose skin (Yes, I have some but it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be!!) and I credit this to IF and Autophagy. 

NSV's have been plenty but my favorite of all time was being able to sit in an Airplane Seat and buckle the seat belt!  This brought tears to my eyes, I was so proud of myself.  My family has been very supportive and when I am back home visiting my relatives, they totally embrace the Keto Meals I prepare for them.  My neighbors are also asking me about Keto and I'm starting to coach some of them to kick start their journey.  I love ""Prancing"" in clothes that didn't use to fit, and I am dating again.   Those are just a few.....as we all know the NSV's are plentiful in following a Keto Lifestyle.

Thank you again for reading my story and I hope that it inspires others to embrace Keto.  Seriously, if I can do this, so can you, I have struggled my entire life with my weight, losing some only to gain it back with interest. I felt like a total frump and now I feel fabulous and attractive!   Keto WORKS IF YOU STICK TO THE PLAN and your individual plan is what works for you, just keep those carbs in check....watch carb creep and sneaky carbs hidden in packaged foods.  Focus on real, whole foods, ebmbrace the fat and live your best life!!!!  KCKO!!!",1

I quit carbs cold turkey, and since I was so unbelievably ill prepared I binged on McDonald's the next day. On my way home from work I was ""starving"" and bought a large fry, a McChicken, and a 10 piece nugget \(I think that was it, regardless, it was a shit ton of food\) and then binged like my life depended on it. It was my default behavior and I immediately felt like a failure. But Friday was a new day and I hopped right back on track and never looked back. Since then I have had a few not quite Keto foods but still lower carb and a couple of true cheats \(like maybe 2 or 3\) where I had a mini cupcake or a cookie. 90&#37; of my eating has been clean keto though and until I hit onderland I'm keeping strict keto.

Lessons learned in these 6 months:

🦄 Water is super important and so is salt. If I don't get enough salt, I get headaches.

🦄 Cheats aren't worth it while on the fatloss journey unless they are once in a lifetime opportunities.

🦄 Progress pictures are so worth it and help you see your body changing when it still feels the same.

🦄 Keep a few old clothes for comparison but donate or sell the rest. Don't be tempted to regain by hanging on to so many old things.

🦄 Don't rush to buy a ton of new clothes. Buy things that you can shrink into. Dresses are a godsend for women, especially t\-shirt dress or anything flowy. Buy cheap, buy tightish.

🦄 Appreciate your changing body. Things will rapidly look and feel different so take the time to explore yourself and get reacquainted throughout the process.

🦄 Adjust your macros and caloric needs every month using the same calculator.

🦄 Track your food if you need to and it doesn't trigger disordered eating/thinking or turn into obsession.

🦄 Track your weight daily but DO NOT OBSESS. Easier said than done. If it causes stress, don't do it.

🦄 Fasting is great if your body complies but isn't required. If you feel like pushing through the hunger triggers the ED then STOP and eat. I'd rather lose slower than spiral out of control.

🦄 Fasting can be done with water, broth, tea, and sugar\-free gum. Anything that has no calories and causes little to zero insulin response should be ok.

🦄 Protein is a goal, carbs are a hard limit, fat comes from your body so only eat enough for flavor and satiety.

🦄 Comparing yourself to others can be motivational and destructive. Avoid if it becomes destructive.

🦄 Always be kind to yourself.",1

This is 6 months on my Keto Journey, here are some things I have learned and random notes.

I do one meal a day most days.  I use cronometer and document everything I eat.  I consume less than 2000 calories per day and because I run, I create a 500-1000 calorie deficit daily based on my cronometer app.  I also only exercise 5 days per week.

Over the 26 weeks, I averaged 2.35 lbs per week, some weeks no movement on scale, some weeks more.  Never more than 2 weeks without going down.

I consume diet drinks and does not seem to bother my weight loss.  I eat an excess of protein according to some, that also does not seem to affect my weight loss.  I drink alcohol on Friday and Saturday, bourbon and coke zero lately.  I always put the calories in my cronometer and it has not affected my weight loss.  I always try to keep my carbs at 0, I probably never go above 25.

My blood pressure is great 118/80.  My blood sugar is good in my opinion, it was 81 on Friday.  My ketones always above 1.5, over 3 most weeks (I measure once per week).

I have done some 48 hour fasts and can run 5.5 miles after 48 hours and have no issues.  Ain't fat adaption great!!

I am convinced this way of eating works, KCKO, any questions hit me up, happy to help however I can.

&#x200B;

**Edited:**  One thing I should add, it is pays to be purposeful about this diet.  For me, that means getting up at 0330 so I can go running before I head off to work.  It seems like it might suck, but there is a sense of accomplishment that drives me to do it every day.  Sometimes progress takes effort.  Get out there and be extraordinary!",1

Tomorrow makes half a year, but I'm posting a bit early because I'm excited. I started off at 275 on November 1st. The Google search that changed my life. I had been very overweight my whole life. I ate my feelings which made me even bigger. I went into keto never thinking I would ever make it past 260 lbs because it just seemed impossible to me. Here I sit today, at 207 lbs. My goal when I started was to get under 200 which seemed SO unrealistic, and here I am just 7 pounds short of it. I want to thank you guys for being such an inspiration to me. I've been getting weight loss complements from strangers that come into my job and it makes me feel so good. If you're thinking about starting, start right this second. You will love yourself for it 6 months from now. I LOVE YOU ALL! :)",1

I started Keto on a whim on Cinco de Mayo. Today it’s been 6 months. I’ve lost 125lbs and feel really good. M/32/6’ SW:455 CW:330. Had some bloodwork done a month ago and it was all perfect after being pre diabetic and high cholesterol previously. Mental health is at a better place than it’s been in a long time. This is the biggest improvement for me. Anxiety was ruining my life, it’s now barely there and manageable. 

I meticulously weigh and log all my food. If I don’t I’ll slip it works for me and highly reccomend doing so. I eat 1800 calories a day, 14 net carb, 125protein, 125 fat. No cheats or going over on carbs ever. I ate at maintence for 1 day about once a month rest of the time running a pretty big caloric defecit. I’ve been a lot more physically active. Doing things I enjoy like hiking with dogs, golf, weight lifting, swimming etc. My job either keeps me extremely active or sedentary but it’s been a good balance. IF has been a huge part of my success as well. It really helps curb boredom snacking and hunger in general. I try to hit a 18:6 minimum every day usually a 20:4. 

I’m poised to drop the rest of this silly weight. I plan to eat Keto/low carb/IF the rest of my life and keep up with weekly weigh ins for accountability. This sub is a huge motivation for me I read it daily. I’ll post some more progress after the new year. Cheers everyone. KCKO. ",1

Face Gains: http://imgur.com/6D9IfcH

I started out at 285 pounds, and I weighed 212 this morning! I'm 28 and 6'2"". 

I owe all of my success to keto. I started out doing some light exercise (walked about 4 miles a day), but now I just do some exercises at home (some push-ups and crunches, e.g.) consisting of 10-15 minutes/day. So my success mainly comes from the diet itself. 

I plateau'd at 50 pounds and sat there for about 2.5 weeks, so I added intermittent fasting, eating 1 good keto meal a day (typically dinner or a late lunch) and no snacking (so a 23:1 IF, I guess). This was so easy to do after a few days...I got used to it and didn't feel hungry or have cravings. I'm still doing it actually! I really love it, and it got the scale moving again and it just keeps falling! I have all my energy, can still do my workouts whenever and carry on with my daily life - zero adverse side effects with Keto + IF. 

I am 100% sold on the keto lifestyle and all the science behind it. I won't be going back. I really wish I'd found it years ago!!! Not only have I lost a lot of weight, I've not had heartburn since the day I started. I used to suffer from heartburn all the time - had TUMS stashed everywhere: nightstand, bathroom drawer, desk drawer, center console of my car, had a tums to-go pack in my bag. It was horrible. Now? No more. My blood pressure is also down to the low end of normal range! Also: the mental clarity thing is no joke. I really just love the way keto makes me feel, & I haven't been able to say that in a really long time. 

Considering I used to be an obese smoker (yes...gross I know...A pack a day no less...makes me cringe now.) who ate whatever he wanted and drank what could best be described as ""heavily"", I'm really excited to be starting my 29th year in the best condition (both mentally and physically) of my life!

I've been on a ketogentic diet the last 6 months. I've watched my salts, minerals and fluid religiously.

I’m officially down 40 lbs, and although the last 10 lbs have come off slowly it’s been refreshing to look back on my progress pics over the last few months.
When I was getting dressed today I decided to throw on some shorts for the first time since... probably August. For funsies I pulled these floral shorts out from the bottom of my drawer and decided to give ‘em a shot. I bought these shorts in 2014 with the hope they would fit me within a few months of buying them (that’s usually how that works huh?). Well 6 years later they FINALLY fit.
I’m not done yet, but I haven’t been this thin in over 10 years and I’m just so damn happy. 
Anyways, hope you are all safe + healthy during this crazy time in the world.

"64.2 pounds down, 10 days away from 3 months",1494,c0o6gx,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/c0o6gx/642_pounds_down_10_days_away_from_3_months/,116,1560569145.0,"https://imgur.com/a/9vzVMBY 

TLDR; I’ve lost 64.2 pounds on keto! More than I lost weight calorie counting alone. 

⚠️ I’m super sensitive about my “tummy” pictures, but I felt like they add a lot of important information to my before/after so I added them anyway. 

In 2015, I started calorie counting. Over the course of 6 months I was able to lose 50 pounds, and I felt fantastic. I had so much more confidence than I had ever had in my entire life, I appreciated all of the little things, and exercise seemed to be a hobby rather than a chore. When I hit that 50 pound mark I celebrated with a very large cheat day. That day turned into a week, then a month, and eventually 4 years. To this day, I still regret giving up on myself. I told myself that the weight was coming back on no matter what I did, but I never took responsibility for my bad eating habits. 

In 2019, this year, I decided to make a change in March 25th. Today it is 2 months, and one day short of 3 weeks later and I have lost 64.2 pounds with the help of keto. Not only have I surpassed the weight loss that took me 6 months to achieve previously, but I also can’t see myself cheating any time soon. I have 12.7 pounds left to lose until I hit my lowest weight of 2015. And when I get there I will celebrate! However this time I’ll celebrate wisely. Instead of choosing to binge eat any food in sight, I’ll make a keto friendly dessert and enjoy myself properly. When I hit 100 pounds down, I plan to schedule a photo shoot to celebrate my hard work. But this time, I won’t let myself be pulled back in to the bad habits that have controlled me throughout my entire life.

When I started into 2010, I was at the heaviest weight of my life, starting anew and scary program in school, was getting the hang of a new job, and I was terrified about where the year would take me. Now here I am halfway through, excelling in school, excelling at work, and excelling in getting control of my own health. Sometimes life seems terrifying. Sometimes it’s hard and scary to make a change. But sometimes you’ve got to just take life and decide that you’re going to win at any costs. As of now, I can’t wait to see where I’ll leave 2019. I have no fear, only excitement, and I hope I can help others find the same confidence along their own journey.

 [64yo Ketoversary](https://i.imgur.com/tVLgpGd.jpg)

Btw, my father is on keto as well and no longer takes diabetic medication with permission from the doctor, shots and pills after 6 months or so of keto. He is turning 64 this weekend.

Edit: Thanks so much for all the upvotes and comments! I will try to reply to as many of you as I can after work. I know when I show my mom this she will be ecstatic. Another thing to mention is my father has had heart issues for the past 15 years starting with a heart attack and including multiple surgeries. He has had an aneurysm near his kidney for the past few years that a surgeon has been monitoring close to twice a year. This past consultation the surgeon said it has shrank rather than grown or stayed the same like the past visits. Again, thanks so much everyone. I am extremely happy my parents made a change and to see them much more energetic and active has been extremely up lifting.

Edit 2: Obligatory thanks for the silver! I'm proud to say my mother inspired someone to give me my first reddit award. It's her silver as far as I'm concerned. 

Edit 3: So I spoke with my mom and she wants to say thanks for all the motivation and kind words. She expressed a ton of agreement with those in the comments who have similar stories. I'll take the time to respond to as many as I can. She has a link to this subreddit now and will most likely see all of your comments. She's super proud of a post she made in a keto Facebook page getting 1300 likes but the feedback is nothing like the community here in this sub and I find this all very inspiring. I'm sure my mom finds all of your very kind and genuine comments extremely flattering. Some things she mentioned were she has hypothyroidism so to not believe that keto doesn't work with it. That her blood pressure has come way down and the doctor took her from 3 doses, to 2 doses of her medication for it and when she checks at home it seems it's dipping even lower now and may need to reduce the dose again. She also takes medication for regulating her heart as she has had atrial fibrillation issues in the past and the doctor halved that too. She hasn't had any issue since before starting keto. On my father's side she mentioned it's difficult to eat some things due to gout because of kidney damage from the diabetes. He uses lemon and celery seed supplements as well as tart cherry capsules and it seems to help. As a mom she emphasizes eating natural non processed and always reading the labels.

Pizza - 2000cal. 2 beers. 700cal. Cookies. Bread.

I’ve been trying to get healthier for the last few months and have had some success - have lost some 20lb, mostly due to increasing exercise. Recently I plateaued and I learned that carbs were my nemesis and I didn’t even know it!

A week ago I switched to a low carb diet and it’s been incredible so far. My target fat loss is another 12lb or 3% body fat, and it feels like it’s finally within my reach.

Exercise is definitely a little different - the lack of glycogen stores means HIIT isn’t really an option but I can get outside and run 6 miles or do low impact Peloton, which is fine. I’ve started lifting weights again too, maybe I can add a pound or two of muscle.

Vacation is 4 weeks away today so I’ll report back with the final loss.

I do enjoy some carbs so I see myself transitioning back to a low-but-not-this-low diet later. But I’m not going back to the high calorie beer and pizza!",1

I’ve been successfully maintaining for a month or two now. Started at 140 and now at 120. I sort of lazy keto it for the most part, and when my weight starts creeping up to around 125 or so I get strict again for a week or two until I get back to 120. It’s been working really well. Really enjoying a life of confidence! Didn’t think I’d ever have that again. Especially enjoying the attention I get when I’m out in public hehe it’s nice feeling pretty. Honestly if I could do this, you can too. Because I really wouldn’t have thought someone like me would pull it off. I’ve never been known for my self discipline lol until now I guess

No matter what I do though I cannot for the love of God escape the craving for dairy stuff. Usually cakes with dairy in or most often cheese. Milk doesn't bother me I don't like it and I never have massively but cheese I just cannot escape it.

I've been trying to do vegan meals recently, like yesterday I made a chilli and put it on a baked sweet potato (it was disgusting and boring) no matter what I do i cannot escape cheese.. If I make pasta I have to put parmesan on it because otherwise its just shit..possibly because my family are Italian and they have a lot of cheese there.

Example also I tried like vegan sausages and vegan burgers and although they were okay and did taste like meat the thing i was missing was the cheese.. This really really bothers me because dairy and cheese massively causes me acne. The dermatologist tried to make out it isn't from dairy but I 90 percent know it is and I don't know why he's trying to make out it isn't.

I hate most veg so that's off the table, also here in England the veg is shit that you can buy so it just tastes bland and awful, e.g frozen berries. Does anyone have any advice on how the hell to get over this? Like for days I have been craving this shitty mac and cheese processed crap that mum bought in the cupboard but I can't eat it cause last time it did it set my acne off. I've been trying to follow vegan meal prep videos on YouTube and making some of those recipes but, I mean no matter what I do nothing tastes really good. And it's actually kind of depressing. And this is even more frustrating cause I care about the animals hence going veg, but I just cannot stop this craving for cheese or processed crap or whatever...

Its literally the biggest challenge I've ever had lol, my favourite meal before was like creamy risotto which I loved or curry's with a lot of butter and stuff in, but without the dairy stuff just tastes... Shit. Does anyone have any advice? My taste buds are awful and I think it's still from childhood cause I can't go anywhere near anything green like broccoli, cabbage or cauliflower etc or I'll literally throw up. But even things like tomatoes and red pepper I'm noticing just don't have the right flavour they taste kind of bitter when I imagine them to be sweet.",0

I say approximately because once the battery died on my scale at 280lbs in March of 2018, I didn't ever want to put a new one back in.   The battery was finally replaced a month into keto.    

I initially didn't track anything but kept my carbs under 25g and starting doing basic strength training / LISS.   Even with eating way too many calories, 50lbs melted away in 4 months and my strength has increased very noticeably.    

Then came an almost 1 month stall at 230lbs.  Then another stall at 215lbs for just as long.  Now I'm sitting at 205lbs wondering if I will ever hit oneder-land!!  Each time I hit these stalls, I always found motivation hitting up these forums and figured it was time to return the favor.  Especially the ""slow and steady"" posts.  As awesome as seeing all these people losing 200lbs in 4 months is, it was probably stressing me out that I wasn't doing the same.    

For those wondering how I overcame stalls, it was just doing what I already knew I had to do.  Tracking my macros diligently got me past my first stall (along with adding in KetoChow shakes for easier food prep).  IF got me past the 2nd stall along with adding in soccer league for fun on top of training.  No way I could have ever dreamed about doing soccer again with my 2 ""bad knees"".  Turns out they were just tired of carrying along all the extra weight.

Yes it was.

I weighed in on January 1st at 367 lbs.  367.  I was always big, but I played football, I ate boneless skinless chicken breast.  I drank skim milk.  I did every fat-free low carb diet I could.  I kept shitting on myself for failing.  It’s easy.  CICO you disgrace.  

I was very anti-fat.  Fat makes you fat.  Fat turns your blood into butter.  You are failing.  You are the problem.

Figured I had nothing else to lose.  Taking blood pressure meds already, dr ready to prescribe a statin, and borderline diabetic.  

1st month went by faster than I expected.  Blood pressure came way down.  Energy way up.  Hunger way down.  Started skipping breakfast because I just wasn’t hungry.  Stopped taking allergy medicine.  Lost 14 lbs.

After 3rd month, went back to the dr.  They stopped my blood pressure meds.  Ran my bloodwork, everything normal.  Basically said “awesome work, keep it up”.  Almost 40lbs down by this point.

8 months complete and I’ve gone from 367 down to about 287 (flair not updated yet).  A solid 80 lbs down.  I’m still big, still heavy, but don’t feel nearly as uncomfortable as I did.  It’s been life changing.

I’ve had some slips here and there, but this has been hands down the easiest to get right back on track.  This is the norm.

You wanna lose 100lbs? Do you really, really, truly deep down inside want to do it?

Then make it happen!

I’ve always thought the Nike slogan “Just Do It” was clever, but I never truly realized how those three simple words embody the self drive you need if you want to accomplish something. Keto has taught me that if you truly want something enough, whether that’s to lose weight, to be a better person, to be successful in life, shit, even to simply get out of bed on your day off and be productive; anything in life, you want to do it, JUST DO IT! 

There’s nobody standing in your way to make something amazing happen, you just have to put your foot down and start grinding away, day by day, one step at a time.

Nothing happens overnight, but you have to get the wheels in motion, put yourself on the right path, and make shit happen one step at a time.

That’s what keto has taught me.

You have to be the change you want. Nobody else will do it for you.

Anyways enough motivational speaking for today haha, here’s [the progress pics.](https://imgur.com/a/wAN2Dtu/)

I started this journey on July 13th, 2018, it was my third time trying keto, after failing within two weeks the last couple times I gave it a shot. I had bought a really nice jacket that I was super excited about, then when I received it in the mail, I looked ridiculous in it. 

Internally, I thought, “why doesn’t this fit, it’s a 2XL?? I should have plenty of room in it,” but what I hadn’t realized, was more and more of my clothes were becoming oversized 2XL shirts, size 40 pants, and even a few 3XL shirts were in my closet.

It was getting out of control. 

I had put on about 90lbs since high school, when I was at my best weight of 220lbs. I wore an XL back then, which I was comfortable with, and I played basketball all the time to stay in shape. After high school, I literally ballooned, and put on 15lbs a year it seemed like. By the time I was 22 (when I started the diet again), I was sitting at 310lbs. I couldn’t play basketball like I used to (actually had a pretty bad ankle injury that I attribute to the extra pounds putting pressure on it), and I would become out of breath doing simple day-to-day tasks.

I looked at that jacket. I looked in the mirror. I then told myself that I’m gonna fit my fat ass in that fucking jacket, even if it kills me, I’m gonna get my ass in that jacket!

So that’s when the journey began. I started eating strict keto every day on July 13th, limiting myself to 20ish grams of carbs per day. Within my first month, I discovered the benefits of intermittent fasting combined with the ketogenic diet. Then things really took off from there!

Over the course of the last 8 months, I’ve continued to lose and lose, and the change in my appearance brought other changes to my life, as well. I found a new sense of confidence in my life, I started performing better at my job, which led me to finding a better job in the same field, making more money, feeling great about myself.

A few months later, weight was still dropping like crazy! I was looking pretty damn good. My clothes were getting baggier and baggier, so I got new ones. Look good, feel good, right? 

Next thing you know, I’m talking to a girl that’s WAY out of my league.. but she likes me. She likes me a lot. A couple weeks go by, and bam, we’re dating. That was two months ago. We’re still crazy about each other. 

All these amazing changes happening in my life.. I can’t say it was ALL keto that made these things happen, but I can say that keto lit a fire under my ass, gave me self-drive and a confidence that if I want to make something happen, I’m gonna go do it and I’m never looking back!

.......

Today I’m 210lbs. I’m in better shape than I’ve been since MIDDLE SCHOOL. This shit’s crazy man.

Today I wear a size large in shirts, and a size 32 in pants. I literally can’t remember the last time I wore those sizes.

........

You want change in your life? 

Go be that change.

Hello everyone,

Before I started this, I joined this inspirational community and before and after pictures are what really spurred me on to start keto.

8 months later, here I am. 90lbs down. Life is just better. I've had to clear my wardrobe out twice, I've gone from wearing 2xl to medium, and even some small shirts. My plan now is to tone up at the gym now I've come this far. 

So, if you see this and are considering starting keto, do it! It really will be you too if you give it chance and stick to it!

Last Halloween I could barely walk. I opted to work instead of taking my daughter trick-or-treating because I didn’t think I would be able to walk around the block.  My feet were swelling up like balloons, I was diagnosed with HBP, a thyroid disorder, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren’s Syndrome. Something had to be done. My doctor recommended Keto to me (I tried it out a few years ago and lost 30 pounds) so I decided to give it another go. I’m a completely different person today.


EDIT: thanks everyone for the kind words!!  If you are just starting out, or are thinking about it, I know the road looks long and dark, and you aren’t sure if you can make it work.

[https://imgur.com/a/sqvyMtl](https://imgur.com/a/sqvyMtl)

I've lost 97lbs in total and have successfully kept the weight off since last year. Went from 330lbs, 48 waist, 3xl shirts to 233lbs, 36 waist, xl shirts. I started running, rowing and lifting immediately upon starting strict keto. Only carbs that passed my lips over my 9 months of weight loss were condiments I would put on food like bbq sauce and ketchup. I only ate meat, cheese and eggs. 

Some things that I did/observed  
1. Sugar free jello was a life saver  
2. I drank a lot of diet Pepsi. Probably controversial on here but it helped me.   
3. Absolutely no cheating  
4. No ""keto"" fads. Keto is simple... Meat, cheese, eggs.  
5. Counting calories IS important.   
6. Exercise when able. Even walking.   
7. Embrace the suck. Strong cravings tell you you're doing the right thing   
8. I was my own worst enemy. 

  
Something odd I noticed when going through induction, strong taste/smell of tomato sauce. I know it sounds weird, but once I had very high amounts of ketones in my urine, my taste would become very sweet. Also, had strong keto breath. Didn't experience bad keto flu symptoms other than headache during the first week or so. My carb/sugar cravings were INTENSE. During the first few weeks, I was craving carbs like a drug addict craves a fix. Extreme agitation, feeling like I was going to crawl out of my skin. These got better as time went on. 

Your goal is attainable and well worth the pain. I never realized how bad I felt being morbidly obese. Life is much better now. Keep it at.",1

I have been attempting to find pork rinds that my picky pallet approves of. Most of the store sold pork rinds do not taste all that great to me. 

I have found a small local shop that makes their own pork rinds and i found them to be delicious. Upon reviewing the ingredients it lists sugar. Now I looked at some of the store brand pork rinds and they also have sugar listed in the ingredients. 

My question is, should I be worried about the sugar in these pork rinds or is it nominal in small moderation? The store brand pork rinds are still listed as zero carb per serving.

Thank you for the help.

**Edit**

Figured I would post back. I talked to the company owner and he stated that the ingredients that are listed on the pork rinds are mostly from the BBQ seasoning they use. I bought a bag and, holy hell they are amazing. Definitely my go to snack now, and they are zero carb per serving!!!

A BigTexan Onederland,1858,9lweva,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9lweva/a_bigtexan_onederland/,233,1538865561.0,"***Onederland***.  A magical word for so many people.  But for BigTex, ***Onederland*** is a different thing.  ""Big framed"" is the phrase older folks use to describe my body.  Not talking about the fat, but the size of my frame.  The width of my shoulders for example.  Another phrase folks use is ""big boned"".  Alas, I am just a big dude.  And handsome :)           



With my size, ***Onederland*** is not really in my wheelhouse.  If I were to weigh 199 pounds, I would look plain sickly.  Furthermore, it is not a weight class that I aspire to reaching.  I would rather be 240 and somewhat muscular, because as an older guy, I value strength over thinness.   No skinny jeans for me :)



When I began this way of eating, I was looking at needing to lose 353 pounds.  That my friends is a damn big sip of water.  A big damn boulder standing in the middle of my path.  I had some good luck in the beginning.  Then, I found this sub a little bit later and I credit so many of the people on here for helping me keep my resolve.  For helping me chip away on that 353 pound boulder.  And for you newbies, please understand that it was some damn work for the people of r/keto to lift a 590 pound man.  But lift me up they did.    

&#x200B;

My goal weight is 240 pounds.  My high school graduation weight.  I was damn healthy.   Strong as hell.  Fit.  Desirable.  I realize that in my 50's, at 240 pounds, I won't be as strong.  I won't be as fit.  I won't be as desirable.  BUT, it will be enough FOR ME.  Yes, I really do use my ""For Me"" filter.  So FOR ME, 240 pounds equals strong and fit.       



""Oh great BigTex, you have blathered about ***Onederland***, so what is your point here?""  Well this morning, after I woke up, I was taking my morning tinkle and looked down at my feet (yes, somewhere along the way, I could start seeing my feet when I peed).  I looked at my feet and saw that I really NEED to trim my toenails.  I started trimming my toenails.  Then I remembered that I had not weighed myself this morning.  So, in mid trim, I hopped on the scale.  My scale speaks and displays the number.  Today, I heard some magical numbers.  Then I looked down and saw some magical numbers.      [Here You Go](https://i.imgur.com/dBGB7In.gif)



23 months and 253 pounds lost.  That sounds nice.  But to me, what sounds even better is 100 pounds to go.  FOR ME, my 100 pounds to go is MY ***Onederland***.  On November 14, 2016, I was looking at a HUGE number.  On October 6th, 2018, I am looking at a ***BigTex*** ***Onederland***.  And my ***Onederland*** is WON DER FUL!!!



Lurkers and newbies.  Perspective is a hell of a thing.  You are sitting there feeling hopeless.  You are sitting there saying to yourself, ""Holy shit, I have to lose 100 pounds.""  I stand before you proud and happy that I ONLY have to lose 100 pounds.  Your attitude will determine your results.  You can control the food you eat and your attitude and therefore, you can control your results.  OK, I will hop off my soap box (Yes, I can hop now also).      



I am feeling JOY!  I am feeling EXCITEMENT!!  I am feeling CONFIDENCE!!!  I am feeling PRIDE!!!!     



ONLY 100 pounds to go.

A Perspective for Others (Opinion),1,j7j3qj,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/j7j3qj/a_perspective_for_others_opinion/,6,1602212294.0,"What’s going on everyone. I’ve been in this community for my entire keto journey and think it’s an amazing place for others to share their experiences/tips & tricks. 

However, the more and more I stay on this diet, I can’t help but think about a new perspective I’ve come across along the way. Now, I’m no doctor or nutritionist or anything so don’t take this as legitimate advice or truth, but it’s just my take. 

I started out Jan. 13th of this year at 282 and am down to 194 as of this morning. It has been an amazing journey. The real question I guess I have is was keto really the reason I lost the weight? Or was keto simply a mediator in helping me not eat as may empty carbs and therefore lowering my calorie intake causing a caloric deficit...I know keto has other benefits but I feel like people think that if they eat 2700 calories worth of healthy fats and proteins, they will lose weight because it’s “keto.” I can’t see this possibly being the case since the only way to really lose weight is being in that deficit and having your body begin to use stored fat as energy.

Either way, I am thankful for what keto has done for my life in every way. I just wanted to share my thoughts and illustrate that eating keto food isn’t the only solution, it’s a full diet & lifestyle change that requires consistency and discipline. 

Feel free to add your thoughts below :)",1
A Plant Based Diet Really Helped Clear Up My Acne,36,iu8asi,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/iu8asi/a_plant_based_diet_really_helped_clear_up_my_acne/,4,1600330654.0,"I have had acne since 4th or 5th grade so about 11 years.

I had been eating a lot of eggs and some cheese. Cutting out those two things helped a good amount. Once I really started eating plant based, maybe one meal a week not, my acne really cleared up fast. Within 2-3 weeks it was noticeable enough for my roommate to compliment me on it. 

Maybe people get acne for different reasons, but food was the main reason for mine. Maybe a little bit around my shoulders from sweat and rubbing against my clothing and some from stress, but damn food was it. I have been staying at my family’s house the last few weeks and it has been difficult to eat plant based. My acne came back quick.

From 96kgs (211lbs) [though hit 106/233 at some point a year before this] to 68kgs (149lbs) in exactly one year of following strict keto for the first 7 months, with lazy keto and fairly regular cardio (swimming) for the last 5. 

In previous update posts I've talked a lot about how body dysmorphia has hindered my progress at many points along this journey, but mainly in my ability to truly be able to take a step back and see how far I've come. This is in large why I did not post an update when I hit my actual 1 year anniversary 3 weeks ago, because somehow the fact that I did not hit my ultimate first goal of 65kgs, made me feel that I had failed in some way. 

If I may speak to myself frankly... that is fucking ridiculous. I have come so far in the past year - both in an obvious physical change, but also in the general improvement of my mental health and motivation towards life in general. 

I'm proud of myself! I feel amazing! I need to stop thinking constantly about how much prouder and how much better I could feel a little ways down the track... because at least I'm actually heading there - as opposed to year after year passing with the number only staying stagnant or going up. 

[So here is my progress so far,](https://imgur.com/a/plGzt) a working progress that I am all the more excited to commit to steak and eggs and loaded-as-fuck cobb salads for another 12 months, might even throw in a cheeky 5k at some point just to really stick it to that part of my brain that is still convinced that I'm not actually 'doing it' yet. 

More importantly, I want to help those that are struggling with not always feeling motivated, not always seeing the changes and not always feeling different even if they and everyone else can see it. KCKO - it works - it's worth it. TAKE PROGRESS PHOTOS and just keep on going. It's normal to not always feel totally motivated or totally centered on the task at hand, but trust me when I say: having a day where you've somehow convinced yourself that you haven't made enough progress will not erase the progress you have made; but going back to your old habits absolutely will. 

Today I felt like I was living in my old body, I felt insecure and unhappy. So I looked at my progress photos, told myself I was being ridiculous, and I realized that there is an entire community here going through the same thing, trying to break through the same old mental fuckery, that can give me some props (cause I've done well, yeah?) and that I can hopefully provide some inspiration for if you're in a similar position. 

Thank you guys, here's to 2018 xx

So a little over a year ago, I started keto. And by keto, I mean the laziest version you could imagine. Both physically and dietary. Every six months or so, I'd check back in with r/keto and write (typically a long winded) post about the process, progress and what I learned along the way. 

The two best pieces of wisdom I can provide for those who are starting or thinking about starting, would be:

1) Start now. Don't wait for the new year, or use some other excuse like I did for over 3 years before even attempting to change myself. I'd tell myself, ""I can't live without 2% milk"" or ""I've been big this whole time, why change now?"" Honestly, I'd tell myself the dumbest shit so I could eat 12 taco bell items for lunch.

2) Don't think of this as a diet. Think of this as a way to reprogram or retrain your eating habits. If you're remotely like me, every meal is one you walk away from hurting cause you're so full and oreos are a way to avoid boredom. Take a hard look at what has caused you to end up in a place where you want to change yourself. Oral fixation? Boredom eat? Depression eat? Literally just like all the foods all the time? Work on correcting that. Work on listening to your body. It'll tell you when to eat and I don't mean you thinking to yourself, ""I got snacks out there, and they should be in my belly"" 

I lived off sausages, atkins frozen meals, steak, chicken, broccoli, green beans, lily's chocolate, enlightened ice cream, quest pizza/bars and every other ""lazy"" keto items out there. I didn't start walking, running or lifting during my time. I figured that wouldn't be something I'd continue indefinitely, and would be detrimental when I did stop. I continued living the same way I have for the last 30 years, minus my food choices and eating habits. 

Over the last few weeks, I've been slowly transitioning into eating ""normal food"" again. Mainly, on the weekends while still doing keto during the week. I have noticed when eating the things I was pre-keto, my portions are smaller and I stop myself when I'm full, versus shoveling what was left still down the hatch like it was my death row meal. 

Sadly, My way isn't going to be yours, however you're more than welcome to try. If you're interested in lazy keto items, I'm a fountain of knowledge there, so feel free to ask. 

I wish you all the best with your journey and I ask those still continuing, or just beginning, to continue assisting and motivating those in the community to better themselves.",1

I officially hit 100 pounds lost the other day. So I thought I would make a post about my weight loss. I started doing keto because my grampa passed away on jan 1st from complications from an emergency quintuple bypass surgery. He has had heart attacks, him and his father both died young because of their heart health and it runs in my family. After a month of handling the death poorly, eating garbage and heavy drinking, I decided to change my life. Keto has changed my life. Aside from the obvious, losing a shit load of weight in the past 11 months, I have accomplished so much. I got promoted, I went off of my antidepressants and am no longer depressed, and I am happy and healthy. I changed my major for the final time and found my passion is nutrition. My blood work is insane, my total cholesterol is something like 125 and my triglycerides are somewhere around 35-40. My blood pressure is normal and was previously bordering hypertension. All better results than when I was 19.

I have had ups and downs, more cheat days than I can count, and am not crazy strict, although I am somewhat strict. I work at starbucks and cant resist a few sips of a yummy drink or a bite of a pastry here and there. I think not being overly strict and allowing myself a bite or a sip has been really beneficial in staying so disciplined. Additionally it makes me feel like it is a life change, eating healthy, and I don't feel restricted. I don't eat super high fat, but I also don't shy away from it. My normal groceries consist of lettuce, spinach, cucumber, olives, eggs, sometimes bacon steak and chicken, and a few other things. I also eat those horrible russell stover candies and some ice cream like halo top, although I found a new one rebel creamery which is amazing. The other day when I hit 100 lbs I joined the gym, as a reward to myself. I have felt soo incredibly discouraged and still do sometimes, because for me the hardest part about keto is the hate it gets and my vegan coworkers telling me I'm gonna have a heart attack, which is a little too close to home for me.If you ever wanna give up because you are discouraged, you plateau, or whatever reason..

I'm going to speak with his parents and hopefully get them in contact with a doctor that knows about lifestyle treatment and a plant based diet/vegan diet.

A lot of ya'll are doing Keto wrong.,1,5my3vi,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/5my3vi/a_lot_of_yall_are_doing_keto_wrong/,36,1484002992.0,"Listen, eating fat is cool. It's delicious. But ya'll don't have to put butter in your coffee, or add extra fat to everything to lose weight. Eating a lot of fat is for people who're already pretty thin on Keto.  

If you're relatively big, or have a lot of fat to lose, what makes you lose weight is eating low carb, not eating high fat. There's too much talk about ratios and this and that. You're over thinking it.  

All this ""kicked out of ketosis"" stuff is silly, too. Relax. You can eat as much protein as you basically want. Do you know how much protein you'd have to eat to stall weight loss as long as you're eating very low carb? It's a fuck ton, that's how much.  

Ketones aren't what make you lose weight. They're a byproduct of losing fat because you're eating low carb.   

So, just focus on eating very low carb. By no means does this mean you can't eat bacon, avocados, cheese, nuts and stuff like that, but you don't *have* to eat all the fat in the world to make this diet work.  

Keep calm and keto on.   ",1

I don’t eat vegetables or eggs but I would be willing to MAYBE try an egg but I can’t eat veggies. I know this sounds pathetic but I’ve had this issue my whole life with textures and am very fussy. 

I know with this many restrictions I wouldn’t have a great variety, but I would be willing to have one meal plan that I could repeat daily if I could find something that works for me. 

I’ve heard you can have meat, fats (butter), cheese and eggs so if I could come up with something with those and maybe some supplements so I’m getting everything I need I’d have one big keto meal a day. 

Would be so grateful for the help to but together a meal I can stomach. Thanks",1
A message to super fat lurkers (like me!),3125,cn3fek,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/cn3fek/a_message_to_super_fat_lurkers_like_me/,349,1565197845.0,"A few years ago I made a [couple](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/6ntcpg/tips_for_super_fat_people_like_me_just_starting/) of [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/6onxem/more_tips_for_super_fat_people_like_me_just/) about keto for those of us with more than a few pounds to lose. I started my journey at 415 pounds. I’ve been asked a few times over the years to write a follow up, but the reality is that I fell off the wagon after losing a shit-ton of weight. I got into a relationship with someone who actively tried to sabotage my health goals, but more than that I didn’t value myself enough to set strong boundaries and take my health seriously (emotionally or physically). I gained a good portion of my weight back, and it was an extremely humbling process. But I’m back! I’m on the keto train, I’m steadily losing weight, I’m working with my doctor, and wanted to share some insight from the experience but also, to speak to those lurkers who are desperate to start but don’t know how, or don’t think they can. In my mind there’s a difference between “losing a 50 pounds would be great!” and “I’m literally dying at the weight I’m at” and this post is aimed at the latter. 

* **First things first, you are not going to find the right time to start.** I hate to tell you, but you will not get a lightning bolt of inspiration. A song/poem/speech/revelation will not come on at just the right exact cosmic moment to start your journey *for* you. If you’re anything like me, you’re waiting for the stars to align and for motivation to strike. But I’m here to tell you, inspiration isn’t tangible or reliable because it’s an emotion, not a habit. For me, I wanted to be in the right situation with the right energy and circumstances and the right support system, but these things are a fallacy. Because your body is working against you. If you’re super fat, you are likely insulin resistant. You are likely experiencing inflammation, aches, poor sleep, low motivation, minimal enjoyment in life. If you’re like I was, food is probably the only thing giving you any sort of enjoyment or relief. When I was 415 pounds, getting to the grocery store was a painful endeavor, how the hell am I going to start a radical new lifestyle?
* **Which leads me to my next point: just fucking start**. You do NOT need ketone sticks to get started. You do **NOT** need a kitchen full of erythritol, Smart Cakes, and collagen powder. Keto is **NOT** expensive, and it is **NOT** the complicated journey we make it out to be. It’s chicken and vegetables and eggs. It’s olive oil. It’s a few hamburger patties. You do not need to be rich; in fact, I’ve never spent as little on food as I do when I’m eating keto because my fat ass eats the hell out of some fast food when I’m not doing keto, and that shit adds up. Keto isn’t expensive, being fat is. Insulin is. Doctors visits, surgery, chronic illness, those big ass clothes I have to purchase at special Fat Lady stores – these are expensive things. Chicken thighs? Not expensive.
* **In fact, I would encourage you, at least in the beginning, to keep it as simple as possible**. When I try and complicate the process with artificial sweeteners, ""acceptable-ish"" fruits, Keto Approved Fast Food, etc. I confuse myself and my results are weaker because I make exceptions and over-indulge. Sure you can introduce some moderate keto sweet treats down the line, but right now you are mentally reprogramming your mind to view food as fuel and not the blood sugar fluctuating Therapist/Best Friend it has been to you for the last X years. Keep it simple, learn to love fucking zucchini, and leave the baked goods for lesser mortals (literally, smaller people). I would encourage you to avoid eating out at all, at least for a while. When you’re attempting to undo years of behaviors and you're sitting squished into that Red Robin booth, deciding to just get the burger and bottomless fries *this once and start again tomorrow* is going to be too tempting. This is coming from a bitch that *never did quite find the bottom* of those damn fries. I recommend avoiding the temptation, at least at first.
* **Your environment  doesn't have to be perfect.** If you’re anything like me, you want the ideal Healthy Living Lifestyle to get started, because making excuses is infinitely easier than doing the work. I’m so ridiculous that I would tell myself that there’s no point in beginning a healthy eating lifestyle *now* because I’m going on vacation. In two months. I’m a fucking idiot. But more than that, I was scared. I feared the commitment and work and I was terrified that if I actually tried, I could fail and failing made my weight seem more like a death sentence than a temporary state that I could fix… if I tried. See how vicious that cycle is? But that’s the great thing about keto, is that once you get out of your head and actually start, it gets easier and easier until you wonder how you lived any other way.
* · **The battle is mental, but don’t discount the physical aspect of this journey.** I had a ritual of stopping at Taco Bell after work, every day, and eating about \~3,000 calories. I was eating because of my stress of the day, but I was also fucking hungry! I deserved it after working so hard, I told myself. I inevitably would kick myself when finally pulled into my duplex driveway, covered in shredded cheese and shame, because I knew that it was another day of failure and weight gained instead of lost. In my mind the battle was extremely mental, **WHICH IT IS!** But there’s also an incredibly insidious physical battle happening, too. When you are super fat, your insulin and hormones are FUCKED. Your body is extremely bad at utilizing the nutrients it receives, so it stores your just-eaten food as fat and you’re constantly hungry but extremely inefficient at, you know, eating. When you start eating LC/keto, your body almost immediately starts correcting the insulin sensitivity, because you’re eating foods that don’t spike your insulin, and it makes you *actually* satiated which is something our big bodies aren’t used to. I could sit across from my skinny friends and watch them pick at their salads or whatever, just positively *fiending* to finish their meals even though I just ate what was probably too many calories anyway. Once my doctor explained insulin resistance, it all made sense. When you’re overweight, you’re not playing a fair game. Trying to lose weight while still eating high carb foods means you’re never going to feel satiated, and constant hunger is such a miserable and defeating way to make lasting change. And even though the battle is stacked against us physically, we still have to do the work. I spent a lot of time angry that it was *so hard* for me to lose weight and my victim mentality kept me stuck. It may not be your *fault* that you are the size that you are, but it is your *responsibility.* Being mad about this will not change the scale, the only thing that will change this is fighting the battle using the best tools we have: science and habits.

So what can you expect when you follow my advice and **fucking start?** Keto is a very YMMV thing. I can’t tell you 100% how your life will change, but I’ll tell you what happened to my fat ass:

* **My hunger subsided almost immediately.** Within a day or two. Worry less about how many calories you eat and more about the quality of those calories. Eat the living fuck out of some chicken and broccoli. Keep hard-boiled eggs on you like some sort of Poultry Superhero. Be ready to challenge cravings with fat and protein. You're less likely to pull into the Burger King drive through if you are up to your eyeballs in string cheese.
* **Your energy will skyrocket.** When you’re not subsisting on Door Dash pad thai two times a day (not that I would ever do that!), you’ll find that you have way, way more energy. It’s almost magical. And once you start feeling better, you start getting ***fucking angry*** that you spent so much time and money to feel sluggish as shit for so long. Our bodies were not meant to process so many carbs as often as we have been, and it really just makes your energy fucking tank. I’m to the point in my keto journey that the idea of a Frappuccino (which used to be my shit) actually makes me *feel* lethargic, even thinking about it. The carb crash is real.
* **Your motivation will beget motivation.** Here’s the thing about motivation: it only really works when it is self-reinforcing. Nobody else’s journey will push you towards change like seeing your own progress. When you can actually walk without pain, you jump out of your chair without groaning, when you actually feel excited about going for walks and meal prepping and playing around with different spices in your cooking, THAT is motivation. If you wait until a chicken thigh *sounds* more appealing than a cookie, you’re never going to get started. 
* **Your sleep will improve, your breathing will become easier, you’ll get fewer headaches.** After a few months on keto, I could start to feel bones that I didn’t know I had, which was both exciting and existentially nauseating (wait, you are telling me I have a fucking *SKELETON*? I am mortal. I am bereft.)
* **A lot of the aches and pains associated with constant inflammation will clear up within weeks or even days.** Your body will hurt less to operate. I started my journey with constant, chronic pain *in my twenties*. And while I still have some pain (and still have quite a journey to go), it’s exciting to see the progress from “yeah, that knee is just gonna hurt like a bitch forever” to “wow, I can actually stand on that knee for more than 15 minutes without wanting to chop it off and throw it into the sun”.
* **Other areas in your life will remarkably improve that you didn't expect.** My finances when I was supporting a 415 pound body were a fucking joke. My relationships were hugely suffering because I didn’t want to *see* people when I was out of breath just walking from my car. Nobody wanted to date me. I was depressed, constantly comparing myself to other people on social media, and becoming increasingly angry at how unfair the world felt. When you start the journey to take back ownership of your life, the things that felt so out of reach will start clicking into place. You’ll have the energy to clean your room, the self-esteem to reconnect with old friends, and the confidence to start living your life and not just watch other people live theirs.

I hope this was helpful at all. If you want to talk, share journeys, berate me, or anything feel free to PM me. I believe in keto, and I’m excited to accomplish my goals with this lifestyle.

A newbie's introduction and a question for making foods less dry,1,j6cfxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/j6cfxk/a_newbies_introduction_and_a_question_for_making/,0,1602043504.0,"Hi all, Matt here.

I've recently started WFPB, and to be fair never thought I could.  Previous Keto guy here, and I did lose weight - but as soon as I had anything not allowed it would de-rail me instantly.  So that is all in the past now and I'm back to square one weight wise.

So, the first issue I found is an alternative to butter.  The reason being, I love baked potatoes!  However, I found it pretty dry without butter.  So I need to get that sorted.   To be fair it probably isn't a butter alternative I am looking for, more something to make things less dry.  Any help would be greatly received!  


Secondly, I am massive pudding person.  Yet, somehow a piece of fruit seems to hit the spot right.  It is mental!  Usually it would be like cheesecake, trifle, custard, chocolate cake - yet somehow an apple or a couple of figs do me fine!  


Looking forward to moving to a full plant based diet - I am currently just trying to make as many meals WFPB as I can, but using up whatever I have left from my old way of eating because I hate waste.  In reality this is mainly some tuna and a bit of cheese left.  But I haven't purchased anything else.

I find generally that as soon as I eat in the morning, it gets me hungry, but if I leave it til lunch time i'm always fine.  So generally now I don't have breakfast.  I've just been hammering a big bowl of porridge oats at lunch with water, and smash a banana in it and some pumpkin seeds and some berries - that sorts me out.  Then in the evening I have eaten baked potato or chickpea curry and rice or some wholemeal bean burritos.  Again, the only real complaint I have is that sometimes they get a bit dry.  


Aynyway, nice to meet you all.",0

It takes a while to synthesize all the information, and I found mostly great support on here.

Please be kind to the noobs who are here looking for information and have questions.

Basically it is one of the most needed minerals in your body.

Now, i know you guys love meat here. All these posts with a metric fuckton of meat saying ""Oh im ready to start keto so im gunna eat and shit out this cow"". are kind of getting the wrong idea here.. Strait up fat and protein isn't really the keto diet, and most of these foods don't have..potassium..or any nutrients really besides fat and protein (though many people are starting to make it more about the protein really..which can be catstrophic for not just your poor colons..).  Make sure you get your veggies in, atleast enough to hit your daily amount of potassium and fiber or that monster meat pizza you gorged on will come out as a monster 10 pound brick of rock solid poops. 

The whole diet is based off of fats and fiberious vegetables. The only reason you include protein is essentialy because there is a daily protein requirement reguardless of your actual diet, and on keto there is a slightly larger protein demand (we are talking the amount of like 3 eggs would suffice, Not a whole entire herd of cattle here.)

If you cannot get potassium, Iron, and other Minerals into your diet, atleast try to get some of the substitutes in, like potassium saltwater or daily vitamin/mineral pills.

People, this is a very crucial issue. I understand this diet is great, but for the love of god, save your colon.

"A warning about ""keto-friendly"" junk food and snack habits",1703,98jrg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/98jrg6/a_warning_about_ketofriendly_junk_food_and_snack/,382,1534708833.0,"Hello fellow ketoers!!  I hope you are having a fantastic day.    

As the keto diet catches on in the mainstream and enjoys well-warranted increasing support from the medical community, food manufacturers are beginning to capitalize on the growing popularity of our way of eating (WOE).  I'm sure you've noticed the increased number of advertisements for ""keto-friendly"" chips, candy, and other kinds of junk food.    

On the one hand, this is a great development, because it's nice to have quick and easy ways to diversify the kinds of things we can eat on the keto diet, and to enjoy some of the tastes (or close to them) of carb-based things we used to eat before we embraced this WOE.    

On the other hand, many of us who live a keto lifestyle do so now because we did not have healthy eating habits before keto, and needed to make a change (I know that I'm part of that group!).    

So here is the warning:    

**If you struggled to control your eating habits before you started keto, please be mindful of your relationship with the new ""keto-friendly"" junk foods.**    

Why?    

Because consuming more calories than you burn will still cause you to gain weight, even if the calories you consume were made with almond flour and sugar substitutes.  *If you struggle to control yourself around snack foods - like I do - filling your pantry with keto-friendly snack foods may not be a great idea if your goal is to lose weight.*    

The reasons why we lose weight on the keto diet are multiple:    

**1. Water** - Carbohydrates increase water retention.  (This is why we lose weight so quickly at the start of the diet - reducing carbs = eliminating a lot of water we had stored in our bodies).    

**2. Appetite** - The fatty & protein-rich foods we now eat cause us to feel satiated (full) on fewer calories than we did when we included bread, potatoes and other starchy, high-carb foods.  As a result, we eat fewer calories than we did before keto, resulting in a lower body weight.  

**3. Insulin** - I'm not an expert on insulin and am not qualified to explain to you at all why insulin matters... *but insulin matters*.  In response to a number of the comments below, I've edited this post to include insulin as a concept, and encourage all of you to read [this article](https://www.dietdoctor.com/new-paradigm-insulin-resistance) by Dr. Jason Fung, author of The Obesity Code if you want to understand the impact of insulin and insulin resistance in our bodies, and why a low-carb, high fat diet and intermittent fasting (IF) are intelligent approaches to managing our health.

**4. Mindfulness** Maintaining a strict (or lazy) carbohydrate limit *requires us* to think and be mindful when choosing our foods and living our lives. When offered food, we no longer simply think ""oh boy!"", our first thought is now ""should I eat this?"".  In addition, the early success of the keto diet has inspired many ketoers (including myself) to consider other aspects of our lifestyles and make healthier decisions about exercise and activities.    

So - when I see a targeted ad telling me that I can have ten new flavors of keto-friendly chips, or that I can eat candy bars with single-digit net carbs, or stuff my face with any number of delicious non-meal treats... I know that *for me*, there is a very real danger that I will find myself on the couch in front of the television with **far** too many of these snacks within grasping range.    

If this rings true to **you** - if you *know* that deep inside you is a tiny, spiteful little snack demon that is *mega-hangry* after being neglected by you and your selfish insistence upon adopting a healthy lifestyle, and is just *dying* to dive into a bottomless barrel of snacks and go buck wild, then here is my advice to you:    

**1. Dance With The Girl That Brung Ya** - you have discovered a healthy way of eating, and have committed to being a healthier person. Whether you have just started, or are a multi-year veteran that hit your goals ages ago, *you know that what you've been doing has been working.* Do not let some corporate marketing exec ruin it by targeting your weakness.    

**2. Track Your Calories** - MyFitnessPal is a great app for counting calories in and out, although there are plenty of others that are also great. You can also easily make a spreadsheet, or download one of countless pre-made sheets to track calories. There is a ton of great info in the [Keto For Beginners](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/keto_in_a_nutshell) link on the sidebar.  Counting your calories will help you quickly recognize the situation if you end up eating more of these snacks than you should. If you find yourself staring at your spreadsheet trying to remember how many of the snacks you ate, then you ate too many, and these snacks are not for you.

**3. Give Yourself a Snack Window** - If you *absolutely must* try every ""keto-friendly"" junk food that hits the market, do yourself a favor and give yourself a one-hour window, once a week.  From 6-7pm on Sunday (for example), you can enjoy all the low-carb candy, popcorn, chips, cakes, doughnuts, etc that you can eat. Spend the rest of the week getting excited about your next window. Try not to buy the food until the day of your window, so that you don't have to resist the temptation to jump the gun and dive in outside of your window. If you find yourself breaking your window and wondering why you thought it was a good idea, then these snacks are not for you.    

 **TL/DR: There are a lot of new ""keto-friendly"" snack foods on the market. If you have a history of chronic binge-eating, it is probably not a smart idea to start binge-eating these snacks, either if you are trying to lose weight. Calories matter. Be mindful.**

I was in the hospital writing a goodbye letter to my kid in case I didn't make it home. That's when my doctor asked me if I had ever heard of Keto. 

I had, actually.  My spouse had recently started it. It seemed crazy and impossible, though he swore it made him feel better. But... Bread! Pasta! Sweets! How could I live without carbs? I had already given up dairy due to lactose intolerance. Would life be worth living without carbs too?  But as I was there in the hospital it came down to whether I loved my family more than bread. No-brainer. And while I felt like I couldn't live without carbs, my doctor was saying I was certainly not going to live much longer WITH them either. 

I went on keto immediately. 

A year later I am 50 lbs down. No longer need blood pressure meds. I no longer am sick all the time. No more migraines. No more constant gastro-intestinal distress. (well except when I don't get enough fiber, but that is fixable). Oh, and the best part - No more lactose intolerance!!!!! I got dairy back!!! I can eat all the cheese! It turns out that my issue was only when dairy combined with carbs. I had to pick one or the other. But dairy alone gives me no problem. (Before with carbs+dairy, I would be doubled on the floor like I was being stabbed) Ice cream is out because of the carbs from sugar. But cheese!!! How I missed you!

Keto was hard for me. I LOVE food. (I am addicted to food too) I also didn't lose weight at all for months and months at a time while my spouse dropped 85lbs like it was nothing.  I still miss croissants and brownies. But it isn't overwhelming anymore. I still have a lot more weight to lose. It is hard and slow. 

But no matter how hard keto gets, it is infinitely better than my kid having to read that goodbye letter.

Thanks, Keto (and thanks to the folks on this post who helped me on the journey.)",1
A year of keto. I got the girl of my dreams. I am thankful.,1393,d03wrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/d03wrf/a_year_of_keto_i_got_the_girl_of_my_dreams_i_am/,134,1567733334.0,"Howdy, y’all! I am a long time lurker of this sub. I wanted to make this post to inspire those who may need it and thank those here who have helped inspire me to reach my goal!

I am 6’4 and started my keto journey at 260lb. You can see in the first photo, I was uncomfortable in my own skin and would receive discouraging comments from close family members about my weight and appearance. A close friend of mine inspired me over the course of a year without preaching to me once that I decided for myself that I was going to do something about my weight. That’s when I started keto.

My first month I lost 20lb. Amazing. I stopped there. I was happy. I went back to eating how I liked. Over the course of the next six months I gained back 5lb, though. So I decided to do another month of keto.

Month two: 25lb more lost. I was 220lb at this point. This was when I could finally see a major difference in my face. I knew I wasn’t done, though.

4 months after my second round of keto I was heartbroken from a girl. It was truly go time. Nothing got in my way this time. I went hardcore, healthy keto for 3 weeks, then added working out on the last week. I hit 195lb. I couldn’t believe it when I saw myself in pictures and looked in the mirror. I was a different person. I had a real smile now.

After the last week of working out with keto I started adding carbs back into my diet, but I was being more conscious of what kind of carbs I ate. I have maintained working out ever since and got down to 186lb even after stopping keto. 

One year. Only three months total of keto. 74lb lost.

Nearly the same day I hit my goal weight of 190lb, I met the most beautiful, sweet girl I had ever met. She started flirting with ME. I was in denial for a several days as we kept talking. I finally accepted that life wasn’t playing a prank on me. I asked her out. We’ve now been dating for over a month. Every moment has been like a movie. Simply perfect. I have keto to thank for giving me confidence in myself and my ability to change for the better.

If you’re reading this, and you’ve been lurking this sub for a year or so like I did and not doing anything about it, don’t worry. You can, and you will do it. You may not do it all at once. It may take you half the time it took me, it may take twice as long. It doesn’t matter. What matter is that you do it to your best ability. 

Honestly, I’m just happy and thankful, y’all. I’m thankful for y’all. I’m thankful to God. I’m thankful for me. I’m thankful for my body. I’m thankful for my girl. 

Thank you all.

I can normally eke through it by taking stimulants about twice per week, being really productive on those days, and then not taking them the rest of the week to stop myself from getting too used to them and needing to up the dose. (I have a love-hate relationship with needing the meds.)

However, I'm having two problems now. #1, the meds, which are stimulants and work to suppress my appetite together with keto mean that eating on those days is mostly not happening. I don't think this is a problem, because it's basically IF right? What do I need to be careful of so that I don't cannibalize muscle or set myself up for failure?

I tend to feel the meds more. Is this just me? Did you drop to a lower dose?

And if yes on the above, did you struggle with now being hyperfocused on keto to the point where you struggled extra to concentrate on work? I feel like it's lose lose. I'm having so much success with keto, that it's all my brain wants to think about, and I end up going down keto rabbit holes all day. So maybe I should take meds more often to combat it (keeping my job would be good). But then it's so intense when I do take the medicine it's not as effective- I get that speed sort of edge, pressured speech, dry mouth, no hunger, etc. And I'm not even sure whether the lack of hunger is problematic.

Before I get into my long winded story, here's my progress! http://imgur.com/a/V4ateZ4

I've been posting and reading stuff for a while on this subreddit, and you guys are an awesome and supportive group. I started my journey at the endish of November 2017. I hated my job, my shape, and myself. I was also in the process of figuring out what I could do to help with my Crohn's Disease (see edit below). My SO had been doing keto for a couple years and lost an insane amount of weight. So one morning I woke up and just decided that today was the day. No last hurrah, no 'one more slice', no final binge. I had decided it was enough and I jumped into my keto lifestyle.

The coolest part I think is that I really haven't lost any actual weight for the past 8 months or so. But even still my body is shrinking. It's incredible and every morning I feel like a new person. There was definitely a period of time where I felt very dysphoric, but I worked on it and I was able to help myself get better. 

The changes are amazing, and now that I've been in maintenance for a while, I'm (hopefully, if I can get off my ass) going to start doing weight training and also FIX MY POSTURE. I never realized how being fat and sitting around all day could destroy my posture so drastically. I've started to stretch every day and it hurts so bad. But it hurts so much less than dealing with pelvic tilt and turned in shoulders. That was probably the most unexpected part of the weightloss.

Anyway, here is my ""day in the life"" and my beginners guide. I've posted them on here before, but I'll keep doing it even if it helps just one person:

Beginners Guide:

Keep your electrolytes up. Half the reason people think keto is so hard is because the diet has a diuretic effect. Overload on electrolytes in the first couple weeks. Powerade zero and pickles were my lifesavers.

Don't try to replace foods in the beginning. Stick to simple foods that taste good. Nuts, cheese, steak, bacon, eggs, spinach and pork rinds are a better choice over making a crazy recipe. It will help you adjust until you are more comfortable with the diet

LOG EVERYTHING. I had no clue how many calories were in food, or how much carbs/sugar there was in things I considered healthy. I use My fitness pal (the free version). There is a nutrition section that helps you set your macros

Speaking of macros, try to understand each part! 20g of net carbs a day is what I do, but remember, things like fiber don't count. Also, you should look at protein macros as a goal and fat as a limit. In general you should be eating around 5% carbs, 35% protein, and 60% fat.

It's not all about carbs. Figure out your calorie limit and stay close to it. The great thing about keto is because your blood sugar levels aren't all over the place, you only want to eat when you are actually hungry.

-Careful with your vitamin and mineral intake. I realized I was getting Charlie horses at night and it was due to being magnesium deficient. I noticed I was feeling dizzy, which was due to being potassium deficient. Make sure you have all those important parts in your diet, or start taking supplements until you can figure out how to naturally integrate those minerals in. 

Don't do cheat days. I know that sounds crazy, but to me, I'm looking at it the same as when I quit cigarettes. Sugar is an addictive substance and I don't want it on my life anymore.

YOU CAN DO THIS! Find support. Find local keto groups. Find blogs. Don't argue with people about keto because more often than not, it will is frustrate you (people don't understand biology and nutrition as much as we want to believe. Or they freak out because you're not eating fruits). Find recipe sites like ruled.me or the subreddits on here. Arm yourself with knowledge because at the end of the day, you should be doing this for yourself!


A Day In The Life:

My usual day starts with 2-3 cups of coffee when I get up. Coffee has so much in it when it comes to vitamins/minerals your body needs (magnesium specifically).

Then in the afternoon I sometimes eat something small and fatty to fill my stomach up (cheese, almonds, pork rinds). I buy bulk babybel cheese at BJs and snack on those. Sometimes I don't eat. It all depends on if I actually feel hungry or not. I try to listen to my body and not just eat based on my schedule.

Then dinner is usually a large slabs of meat/seafood/tofu (some sort of steak, pork, chicken, shrimp, fish, extra firm tofu) and a fiber veggie like asparagus. Or I make creamed spinach as a side if it fits my macros for that day. I also will eat eggs/bacon for dinner. One of my favorite things to do is to just throw meat, cheese, spinach, eggs, and whatever kind of leftovers I find into a pan. My dad used to make it when I was younger and would lovingly refer to it as a 'garbage omelette'. MAKE SURE you add spinach to your diet. Spinach is a mega super food and a cup of spinach has so much of what you need during the day.

Meat wise though, I live in an area that borders an area that would be considered rural. My SO invested in a large freezer that sits in our garage. Sometimes we do a Co-op and purchase half of a cow, get it chopped up, and live off of it for months. If we can't find a good farm, we go to bulk food suppliers like BJ's and Cosco, and spend about $400 on freezer meat. Ends up not breaking the budget as long as you are willing to put the entire cost up front, and it lasts for around 3 months if you buy right and have a strategy for rotating the meat out of the freezer. The co-op option is a little more expensive, but it's fresh and organic and delicious. The big box stores is convenient because it's usually pretty packaged and ready for the freezer.

If I ever want a snack I usually go for: Pork rinds dipped in french onion dip (make it myself by buying sour cream and french onion mix packets), super salty almonds, cheese, Halo Top, a tablespoon of peanut butter, 90% dark chocolate, parmesan chips, slim jims, beef jerkey, Mission wrap burritos, quest bars/cookies, or deli meat. There are also brands like Quest and Real Good who have figured out how to make frozen keto food, so we have a couple of those hanging around for extra lazy days. I've seen one or the other at Wegmans, Walmart, CVS, and Target.

I have also been experimenting with keto specific recipies. Ruled.me is a great resource for weird keto friendly breads and tortillas. You don't actually have to sign up, just start typing in the searchbar. I even figured out how to make hot pockets, which was a triumph! It also help me goes from being an okay cook to a pretty decent cook!

Also I should add. During the day I rotate water, coffee, hot tea, Powerade zero and Coke zero vanilla to make sure I don't get flavor bored and start snacking. Coke putting out all those new diet coke flavors a few months ago is awesome. I have been obsessing over the blood orange flavor. I know people tell you to not drink diet coke, but my philosophy is that I can either choose a sugary drink, or choose the substitute, so I go for the lesser of two evils (in my mind at least!). We recently decided to switch to a soda stream and have cut back on how much we spend on soda, and how much waste we create, which is awesome! They also have a ton of diet options so it's extra easy. I totally recommend getting one if you are in to carbonated drinks.

But THE MOST important thing I have found to keep me going in this keto world is spices. Please, do yourself a favor and throw out those garbage $1 spices that all taste like cardboard and invest in some good shit. I personally love anything made by Penzeys spices. They are delicious, and worth the price for how long the spices last. If you can't afford it, check out your local middle eastern markets. You can find great spices for cheap. But for those, it usually makes sense to buy bulk. Or grow your own spices. Honestly find what works, but don't short sell yourself on flavor enhancers. Taking yourself to flavortown is half the fun of cooking.

So that's my story! Let me know if you have questions. I love helping people out 😊

Edit: Just a quick edit for the snacks I listed - not all of them are zero net carbs, most of them are 5 net carbs or less. Mission wraps makes a low carb specific wrap in light blue packaging that is between 5-6 net carbs (depending on if you are getting the whole wheat ones or not). If I start binge snacking, I try to not binge on things that have more than 2-3 net carbs in them. I definitely never eat more that one Quest bar a day, or more than 2 wraps a day.

Edit 2: I DON'T KNOW HOW I FORGOT TO MENTION THIS: One of the main reasons I started keto is because I have Crohn's Disease. I was diagnosed around the age of 21 and it has been a serious struggle. For those of you who don't know, Crohn's Disease is an irritable bowel disease, and is also considered an autoimmune disease. You're body attacks your digestive tract from mouth to gut. Some symptoms are mouth sores, multiple bathroom trips a day, bleeding, nausea, vomiting, fissures, fistulas, blockages, and a whole myriad of non gut related issues like joint pain, headaches, etc. A flare for Crohn's is comparable to someone repeatedly scraping an ice pick down the entirety of your intestinal tract. I found out that sugar was a big food related trigger of mine. Between keto, a really powerful medication called Remicade, and some other things I do, I have been able to put myself into remission. It has helped me on my healing journey so much. I was terrified at first because most of the food that is keto friendly is not listed as safe Crohn's foods. Both my PCP and my GI doctor were in agreement for me to try keto so I went for it. My baseline from a few years ago is comparable to a flare now. And in the past year and a half, I have maybe had 3-4 flares total. All of it together (the meds, the keto, the other shit) has saved my life and I feel like a brand new person.",1

Advice for helping husband?,7,j4g6s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/j4g6s0/advice_for_helping_husband/,19,1601765091.0,"Hi all! I’ve really enjoyed transitioning to a mostly plant based diet over the last few weeks and that’s due to the fact that I love cooking, and I love healthy food. My husband, however, doesn’t cook and doesn’t really enjoy healthy foods. He’ll eat a WFPB meal that I cook but right now only if I add meat or dairy to it. And then if I don’t have prepared food in the fridge and he has to fend for himself for other meals, he eats sugary cereal with whole milk, microwaved taquitos or hot dogs, and Gatorade.

I’m trying to teach him how to put together a grain bowl or salad with what’s prepared in the fridge because I do meal prep for us, but his mindset right now is - if I can’t pull it out of the fridge and directly microwave and then eat it, it’s too much hassle.

He just got some bloodwork back and he has very high triglyceride count and borderline high cholesterol. He’s a lean guy who hasn’t worried about health or weight his whole life, but now this has given both of us a wake up call, and i hope will push him in the right direction.

I guess basically, just asking for some advice on helping a loved one move over to WFPB when they really like their meat, dairy, and sugary cereal, but are open to WFPB because of health concerns? And ideally advice that doesn’t include me cooking and prepping every single one of his meals forever 🙈

TLDR; husband’s recent bloodwork is concerning and I need help guiding him towards WFPB / helping him to make his own plant based meals.

That being said keto has been great and I finally could eat food that I found, in a way, harmful(butter,fatty meats, oil, etc..) in large quantities.

  While I think keto is a great lifestyle, I kind of don't feel the need to continue, and this is not because I'm craving carbs and sweets; infact I would happily continue a ketogenic diet if it wasn't for the fact that I'm only 18 and I LOVE all kinds of food. I have many years ahead of me to worry about my health and to try different diets. I just feel like by going on a ketogenic diet, I deprive myself from a huge variety of food which I can still eat and might not be able to do so in the future, due to various health problems. Not to mention I do not mind a chocolate chip cookie or a slice of pizza every now and then. ;)

   After some evaluation, I have decided to continue with a balanced diet of fats, carbs and proteins. This doesn't mean that I won't return to keto; infact, in the future I might just start it again to enjoy both the physical and mental benefits of eating a lot of bacon and butter! :D

   I am sorry for the long post. I just wanted to share my experience with keto, and thank all of this subreddit for the amazing support and friendliness of the people on it. Take care everyone and see you again, soon... ^^

P.S. Keto on!

P.P.S. Also being part Italian and part Turkish, It is in my blood to eat bread,pizza,pasta and desserts ;)

But I asked myself on that September Monday to just do it for one day. And I did it. So I did keto on Tuesday and made it easily through the week. The weight loss is a huge motivator first. It just falls off. I lost like 15 pounds that first month. More than the weight loss though, I felt so much better. It was easier to move around. I felt like doing more. My moodiness Improved. I’m 51 and starting menopause. Hot flashes like crazy. But I’ve not had a hot flash since February of this year!!!! My cycle is normal. Lol don’t know for how long. It will come back for me eventually. But cheers for now keto!!!

As I said, the weight fell off quickly. But spring and summer were tough. That’s where the work comes in. Weight loss for me slowed. My last 20-25 pounds took me about 5 months to lose.  There were about 6-8 weeks this summer where the scale did not move at all.KCKO. Very frustrating but the scale started moving again. And last week I hit my goal.

I've read a lot about never trusting a keto fart and tales of unfortunate encounters with certain sweeteners, but yesterday I experienced the worst toilet experience of my life. 

**Warning: somewhat graphic discussion about poop ahead**

I basically gave birth to a massive turd after what must have been a 40-minute labor. It was painful; I thought I was going to pass out from the pain. My leg fell asleep sometimes. Had to ask the husband to hang up the phone so I didn't have to make an effort to conceal my pain noises. I even drank some Magnesium Citrate on the toilet hoping that it would help, but then I read on the bottle that it takes 0.5-6 hrs to work. A couple of times I thought I would die there or at least pass out and the husband or paramedics would have to... clean up the... halfway extruded material. 

Probably unrealistic, but I kinda hoped to be rewarded with some major weight loss after the whole ordeal, but my morning weigh-in showed a very small loss not significantly different from my usual. That thing clogged my toilet and felt like it was the size of a toddler!!! 

Disclaimer: No, I have never given birth to an actual human, and I'm sure that that experience is way worse than what I went through, and that scares the s#!t (pun intended) out of me.

Some background info and possible factors:

* I was at the end of my period.
* I hadn't had to go #2 in a few days (don't know how many), but that's become the new normal on keto for me. I didn't feel bloated or anything.
* I used to supplement with about 5g of psyllium husk, but then Cronometer showed me that the low-carb tortillas I've been eating have multiple times more fiber than that, so I discontinued the PH capsules. 
* I have not been tracking my water and electrolytes since I had a major loss in the family a couple of weeks ago. 

Besides fiber and electrolytes, the FAQ recommends 1-2 tablespoons of coconut oil. As a short woman, I am worried about adding this much additional fat, especially since I keep hearing on this sub that fat is a limit, not a goal. I already use generous amounts of ghee, butter, and lard in my food. Is the additional coconut oil necessary?

Obviously, I will go back to tracking my electrolytes and hydration better. Is there anything else I should be doing to avoid a similar episode in the future?

I actually said to my boyfriend, ""It feels like spring in my head"", by which I meant that feeling of optimism and euphoria you get after a long winter when that first springtime warmth is in the air (cold climate dwellers, do you know what I mean?).

I looked at the clock and was surprised to see it was noon and I wasn't hungry. I still had lots of energy, so I decided to walk into town to buy some ingredients instead of driving. I ended up walking a few miles with a heavy backpack on, still fasted. Felt great. Came home and broke the now 24 fast with a great meal of sausage, cauliflower rice, and greens sautéed in garlic and butter. Then went out and did a full late night food shop for the week. Got home at 10pm (when I normally drag myself to sleep) and decided that I was going to first CLEAN OUT THE ENTIRE FRIDGE instead of putting the food straight in. What??!! Woke up again this morning feeling great, and saw I was down 4lbs since two days ago after not losing weight for the last 7 weeks.

Folks, this just isn't like me. My whole adult life I've been sluggish, brain fogged, and prone to sedentary behavior (a nice way of saying a bit lazy). I've suffered from reactive hypoglycemia and have had to eat every 2-3 hours to avoid feeling shaky and dizzy. I could NEVER have imagined being someone who just looks at the clock and says ""Whoops, forgot to eat!"" I've heard about this mystical fat adaptation feeling and at long last- I'm living it! For those of you in the early first weeks of keto, I encourage you to stay strong and keep going! It gets so much easier!

PS- I should add that the last couple of days I have also shifted my diet somewhat- I was eating a lot of cheese/dairy and erythritol (keto ice cream, I'm looking at you) and decided to cut down on that to see if I could break out of my nearly two month stall. It's working! Now that I'm used to the low carb count, I'm focusing on bringing really nutrient dense foods into my daily diet- grass fed meat, fermented veggies, dark leafy greens, etc. Will still be eating fathead pizza (SO good), but more as a weekend treat than as part of my daily diet.

Hooray, right? Who wants pesticide and arsenic in their food? And yet, nowhere on the label does it say whole grain. Isn't that phrase a major thing we look for?

The one ingredient listed is ""organic long grain brown rice.""

So this brand is supposed to be faster cooking, but it did not seem to be noticeably more speedy than the typical 30 minutes stovetop, but I did not exactly stand there with a timer. The cooking pot cleanup seemed easier, less pasty, if you know what I mean.

It's tasty enough, and the grains seemed to cook evenly. The real bonus for me, it's significantly less expensive than the serve-yourself-from-bins organic rice at the local health food store! Like to keep using it if it's whole grain but just didn't appear on the label. Should also add it does not say enriched either. Also doesn't say instant. 

So what's up with this Aldi's organic brown rice that doesn't tell us that it's actually whole grain? That just goes without saying?

Almost 2 months in,21,jbdgd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jbdgd2/almost_2_months_in/,5,1602751561.0,"After a couple of months now on keto, I just wanted to introduce myself. I've been in this sub for a bit, reading posts and getting a ton of information and tips. I finally decided to start keto back on the third week of August of this year. 

A bit of back story on me. I'm 43, female and was diagnosed as T2D a few years ago. My A1C was 6.7 at my highest, which was at diagnosis. I had been on metformin up until about 6 months ago. I took myself off due to the horrible side effects of it. My Dr switched me to Januvia and lo and behold, the same side effects. I stopped taking that a few months after starting and decided I needed to do something different. Not just for my blood sugar levels, but for my overall health. 

Enter August 21st 2020, my first day of keto. I was 187lbs on that day. The first week was rough, as I figured up I had been used to consuming hundreds of carbs a day. I'm not much for sweets, but loved pasta, rice, breads and all the starchy veggies. After the first week went by, it got easier. The next few weeks, it was me figuring out what I liked and what to eat so that I was eating healthy but enjoying what I did eat. My A1C was 6.5 when I had lab work done 5 weeks into keto. My doctor told me to continue with diet and exercise, that what I was doing was improving my lab results.

Fast forward to today. I am now 168lbs and feel so much better over all. I still have a ways to go, and I know with time l will get there. I have a long list of health issues that the elevated blood glucose levels definitely do not help. Keto combined with knowledge of healthier options and adding in some daily walking makes me feel better every day knowing that I have some control over how I feel and how fast/slow my health issues progress. 

So thank you, and a continuing thank you, to users in this sub for all the tips, information and inspiration. I wish I would have started this sooner!

"Alright, let's clear some stuff up.",1,pjfk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/pjfk4/alright_lets_clear_some_stuff_up/,48,1328916384.0,"First of all, if you're serious about losing weight on a ketogenic lifestyle then you need to read [the book](http://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Get-Fat-About/dp/0307272702). If you're a more research-oriented person, then you should read [the Bible](http://www.amazon.com/Good-Calories-Bad-Controversial-Science/dp/1400033462/ref=pd_vtp_b_2).

If you just hang out on this subreddit for keto advice, you're only getting a partial education. If you don't have a solid understanding of the ketogenic diet, you're going to shoot yourself in the foot. Everything I'm telling you comes straight from the two books.

1. 60/35 is too much protein if you're trying to reduce your body fat. Protein, like carbs, causes the body to produce insulin in order to take in amino acids. That insulin is going to make you retain fat as well. Taubes advocates an 80/20 ratio with fewer than 20g of carbs per day. That's right, you should be in induction *every* day. 60-70g of incidental protein a day is plenty for maintaining muscle mass.

2. If you follow the 80/20 rule and keep your carbs under 20g a day, there is NO REASON to count calories. You literally won't be able to put on body fat, no matter how much you eat. The easiest thing to do is to eat the same things every day. If you like bacon and sausage, go crazy. Eat all the avocado you want. Park your butt on the couch and eat a stick of butter. If your body isn't producing insulin, you cannot store fat.

3. You're burning body fat even when you're stuffed to the gills with cheese and bacon. Burning fat isn't a function of caloric intake, it's a function of insulin levels. If your insulin levels are low, you're always burning fat.

4. If you're hungry, go eat some fat. If you even *think* you might be hungry, go eat some fat. The rate at which you metabolize body fat is entirely dependent on how much fat you consume. If you're never going hungry, your body says ""Well, there's no reason to hang on to these love handles in this time of great caloric bounty.""

5. There's no reason to intentionally fast. Chances are, you're already fasting 8-10 hours a day between dinner and breakfast. If you're hungry, your body wants food.

This is absolutely the fastest way to lose body fat. Take this in hand with everything else you've learned here. Drink tons of water, salt the fuck out of everything, eat some leafy greens from time to time. For advanced students, take a potassium/magnesium supplement along with a few thousand IUs of Vitamin D every day.

Edit 1: Here's an MD talking about [low carb](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/pjfyh/thanks_from_an_md_im_cross_posting_from_rpaleo/)

Edit 2: avamava gives a better explanation of the problem with Cal In/Cal Out than I can.

Listen up:

Based on my understanding of GCBC and WWGF, my understanding is that Taubes recommends that you eat when you're hungry and stop when you're full. He does not recommend eating when you are not hungry, or eating past fullness (which, on a very high fat diet, is really hard to do!). But frankly, in my experience, if I eat a bit past hunger it just takes longer for me to become hungry again. My body seems to correct for it.

The problem here is that every time someone starts talking about calories, it's because somewhere in the back of their minds they really believe that they must maintain some kind of deficit.

Here's the thing: this is NOT something the layperson can do. You simply cannot tally up the number of calories you consume (for numerous reasons, chief amongst them being that the counts on the nutrition labels are not nearly as accurate as you would need them to be). Then, the real kicker, you'd need to know exactly how many calories your body used. Unless you have access to laboratory equipment, you really have no idea how much energy your body is using. I don't care how many heart rate monitors you use, or BMR calculations you do.

People can succeed at low carb on low caloric intake. Taubes outlines some early studies where people were put on 1000, 1200 calorie diets that were low carb and compared them to ""balanced"" diets of the same calories. People tolerated the low carb version better, which should be unsurprising to folks here. But they don't have to!

Always hungry at bedtime!,2,i7d9z1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/i7d9z1/always_hungry_at_bedtime/,22,1597121310.0,"Hey folks,

So lately, I have been getting hungry while trying to fall asleep. Like, stomach rumbling, almost light-headed hungry. It makes falling asleep difficult, but at the same time I really don't want to have to get up, make food, brush teeth etc etc again! Plus I eat breakfast around 8-9 in the morning before work and hate having to force it down.

I eat dinner between 6:30-7:30 every evening and typically have a square of dark chocolate and chamomile tea w/ soy milk while watching a show/reading before bed (bedtime is around 10-11).  Sometimes I go for a walk after dinner, but I am typically very active during the day so prefer to relax (landscaping/yard-work 3-6 days per week as my job, with hiking, swimming, yoga, walks, occasional bikerides etc - often on my feet throughout the day!)

I am wondering if the hunger is due to not eating enough throughout the day, or maybe I just need a bedtime snack.  If so, what are some good WFPB bedtime snacks you would recommend for a good sleep?

For a bit more background, I am 21, female, and fairly lean! I've had difficulty maintaining my weight in the past.

Also, I am very not interested in intermittent fasting. Tried it before and it was a vortex straight back into disordered eating! I feel best eating throughout the day at the moment!

Edit) I added a day (sometime last week?) on cronometer as requested, with my extra activity that day (biking on mountain roads - fun!).

Yes there are 2 tsp of oil and some vegan ice cream in there... I'm working on reducing it ahaha.

Basically, breakfast was a yogurt bowl with frozen fruit, PB, flax, chia, a bit of hemp powder. Lunch was tofu scramble with quinoa, veggies, hummus. Snack was apricots and a homemade muffin. Dinner was a black bean salad bowl with avo and some tortilla chips. And then a homemade energy ball, chocolate, and a lil taste of B&J. Looking at it, yeah I guess I am a bit under! Still working on the idea that I - a short female - can eat and often need more than 2000 calories per day!

Latest years my hunger got totally out of control. Never satiated, tired after meals. I heard about insuline resistance and after many diets trying to lose body weight, I always became way too hungry and gave up. Felt miserable and ashamed that I could not lose weight even though I know very much about nutrition and training.

An easy way to explain why Keto is a superior diet,0,515tku,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/515tku/an_easy_way_to_explain_why_keto_is_a_superior_diet/,21,1473049737.0,"When discussing Keto with non-Ketoers (yeah, I'm not very strict with the fight club rules), some people say stuff like ""But you can lose weight on a low-fat diet too"". 

That's correct, but, as I explain, there are four groups of people:

1) Those who can lose weight on a low-fat diet or a low-carb diet. These people don't tend to stay fat for long, they're dieting pros.

2) Those who can't lose weight on a low-fat or low-carb diet. These are the hopeless cases who can't manage to stick to either diet. The only hope for them is surgery, and even that is far from a foolproof option.

3) People who can lose weight on a low-fat diet, but not on a low-carb diet. These people find it easy to stick to low-fat, but low-carb is too hard for them.

4) People who can lose weight on a low-carb diet, but not on a low-fat diet. I'm personally in this category - I don't have the willpower to stay hungry all the time and it bland food which is what low-fat diets are about in practice. I do have the willpower to give up potatoes, pasta, rice etc. 

To determine what diet should be recommended to the general population, you should ask whether group 3 or 4 is bigger. Personally I read cases all the time where people who have tried every low-fat diet in the world without success try Keto and all of a sudden they lose weight. Keto tends to be a last resort because it's so against what we've been taught about diets. I've read of virtually no-one who has failed on Keto and THEN gone on to succeed on a low-fat diet. 

I'm not saying that group 3) does not exist, but I am saying that since Keto is the only diet that actually kills cravings for the foods you are not meant to have (through keto adaptation), it's generally easier to stick to. Low-fat dieters are merely feeding their sugar addiction and trying to keep it at a moderate level, which is approximately as successful as an alcoholic trying to keep drinking at a moderate level instead of quitting completely.",1

An observation.,5,ft3x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/ft3x2/an_observation/,50,1298739887.0,"Hi fellow keto-ers. I've been following this reddit for a month or so, and I finally got on the ketogenic diet a week and a half ago. It's been going well so far, but that's not what this post is about.

I've seen some questions, and some answers, that make me feel like a lot of people don't really completely understand how the ketogenic diet works. I've been searching on the internet for info about the diet for a while, but nothing has come close to the information found in Lyle McDonald's ""The Ketogenic Diet"" book. (bodyrecomposition.com)

His book was by far the most well-cited, and presumably well-researched, information I could find about the keto diet, and I think it will not only answer but pre-empt a lot of questions that seem to pop up on this reddit. Obviously you probably think I'm a bot or something, but I'm really trying to help you. To that effect, I'm going to write a short primer, and hope it is more informative than what you can find on the internet. 

This is my understanding of the diet, and it's worked for me so far-
Your body has 4 fuels- carbs (glucose), fat (FFAs/ketones), protein, and alcohol. Ketogenic diets work by depriving your body of carbs, and thus glucose, and making your muscles and organs look elsewhere for energy. This is supplied by all the fat you've accumulated in your previous lifestyle of ignorant, wanton hedonism (sarcasm). 

1) You need to do anaerobic exercise. While your brain uses about 100g of glucose a day, which is stored in your liver, all your muscles have their own form of glucose (called glycogen) stored for them to use. Getting your heartrate above your aerobic threshold, (by definition) is the fastest way to spend that glycogen/glucose up. This is what you want. This need for exercise is emphasized a few times in the book.

2) You need to get within a certain window of carbs every day. Eating fewer carbs than your brain requires (about 100g) every day will make your body ketogenic. This means, your liver will rip apart the energy stored in your adipose tissue (fat), and create two things- FFAs (Free Fatty Acids) and ketones. Generating ketones = ketogenic. Certain parts of your body prefer one or the other- skeletal muscles prefer FFAs, while cardiac muscles like ketones (I may have switched this up, I don't have the book at the moment). 
If you have never been on the diet before, your brain will still run on 75% glucose until you get about 3 weeks into the diet. At this point, your body is realizing ""Oh crap, this is for real,"" and your brain will switch over to running mostly on ketones. During this switch, things will get a little weird. I haven't gotten there yet, but I read a comment that ""you start having difficulty figuring out things which you know should be easy to figure out.""

3) You need a certain amount of protein every day, unless you want your body to enter nitrogen debt, and cannibalize your muscle. Which happens to some people. It's called.. FASTING. Yes. Protein is the major difference between the keto diet and fasting. If you don't eat enough protein, your body will turn muscle into glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis. (Looking at it as 'gluco-neo-genesis' makes the meaning clearer). If you are trying to lose fat, and not muscle, this is bad. The book edition I read said to eat either 150g of protein a day, or .8 to .9 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight- whichever is HIGHER. For the first three weeks. Around three weeks in, the same time your brain switches over, your glucose need drops dramatically and your body is less likely to cannibalize protein. 

4) You don't NEED to eat fat. Extremely obese patients go on ""protein sparing fasts"" all the time- they only eat enough protein to avoid gluconeogenesis, and their body uses their accumulated fat to survive off of. McDonald cites studies in which severly obese patients went on these diets for years at a time- that's YEARS, eating only vitamins, minerals, and protein. (He also mentions a diet during the 70s which was only the protein, and a crappy one at that,  without the vitamins and minerals.. people died, probably from lack of electrolytes in their cardiac muscles).
Unless you are a competitive bodybuilder and/or anorexic, you have enough fat on you to last for a long time. The reason you are eating still eating some is to A) 'encourage' your body to improve it's fat-oxidizing efficiency, and B) avoid the metabolic slow-down that accompanies caloric starvation. The most important reason you still eat fat on the keto diet is to maintain your daily caloric intake, and keep your metabolism going full-steam ahead. This segues into the next point...

5) You still need to be in a calorie deficit. I know the keto diet is touted as the ""chug bacon grease diet,"" but it's really not. Sorry. You need to figure out your daily maintenance calories, and you need to eat roughly 10% less than that. This sounds similar to most non-starvation-based diets, doesn't it? That's because it is. The difference is that your body is burning fat, and only fat, all the time (as long as you are in a ketogenic state). To be honest, I usually don't make it to my calorie goal, and I'm willing to bet that my metabolism has slowed down as a result.

6) Aerobic exercise, (again, by definition) burns a higher proportion of FFAs than does anaerobic exercise. Just like ""normal"" dieters do, taking the calories spent in aerobic exercise into account with your daily caloric deficit, lets you burn more fat faster. (It is possible to train your body to ""raise"" your aerobic threshold, and thus burn fat instead of glucose at higher heart-rates. Read this for some more info- http://www.gymjones.com/knowledge.php?id=17 Since non-keto dieters have only enough glucose for about 2 hours of exercise [""The Wall"" for marathon runners], burning FFAs instead would pretty much let your run/swim/etc forever. I'm currently working on this.)

7) Did you lose 5-15 lbs in the first 3 weeks of the diet? Good for you!
Unfortunately, it was all water weight. Glucose is stored in your body at a ratio of 1 gram of glucose to 3 grams of water. That is to say, glycogen (stored glucose) is 3/4s water. This is very explicitly stated in McDonald's book, and unfortunately, the second you eat enough carbs to take you out of ketogenesis, you are going to gain any water weight you lost, back. I am sorry- I wish just as much as you do that the ketogenic diet was a ""miracle"" diet, but like you probably learned at some point, ""there are no short cuts."" On the plus side, epileptic kids often stay on the diet for as long as 3 years at at time, and there are many people who stay on it longer- this is sustainable weight loss.

8) You have to make sure not to get TOO much protein. If you do, your body will turn any excess protein into glucose (through gluconeogenesis), and it will probably bring you out of ketosis. 

9) You need to supplement! McDonald stresses a multi-vitamin at the VERY least (remember that 70s diet I mentioned?) and highly recommends further supplementation. The list of things I remember offhand... Magnesium, Vitamin D, Calcium, fiber, potassium (I've heard that too much of this is very dangerous), and sodium. If you don't get enough sodium, your blood pressure will get too low, and you'll feel weak all the time. Plus, everytime you stand up, you'll get lightheaded, and that stops being fun after awhile. 

10) Your, uh, 'stool' will change. Since you're probably not eating enough fiber on the keto diet, you'll have to use the toilet less. Also, all the fat you're ingesting slows down your digestive system, giving everything more time to absorb.. so, your poop will probably be smaller (If you are afraid of using public restrooms, pooping less and less often is probably a god-send).

11) Just want to mention fasting one more time.. McDonald more accurately defines the keto diet as a ""protein sparing modified fast."" As far as your body knows, if you are in a ketogenic state, YOU ARE FASTING, ALL THE TIME. People who don't eat  go into ketogenesis after burning through their glucose... which is exactly what this diet encourages, except we keep our calories up (and therefore our metabolism) by eating fat, and eat enough protein to keep our muscle.

12) Things to avoid- sucrose, fructose, citric acid, and aspartame. These things put glycogen only into the liver, which as you now know, acts as a source of glucose for the body, making it harder to enter a state of ketogenesis.

1. I don’t have flair, sorry. I’m on my phone and can’t figure it out. 
2. I’m not 100%, sure if this belongs but I read the community guidelines & rules and I think it’s OK. 

(Also this is long). 

 I went to a direct sales party with my mom last night that was held in a banquet room at a restaurant. I ordered my favorite cheesesteak, extra peppers, light onions (my carby indulgence) and no hoagie. 

It caught the attention of the girl running the party who also eats low carb. She asked my favorite snacks and some other things etc. people looked at me a little (I’m still ~330 lbs (hopefully less, weigh in tomorrow) but down from 370). It felt really good, almost like I was better than them? Or like they were impressed? Idk, as a super obese person I feel like nobody has ever even really looked at me in years. 

Anyway, we eat and I can only eat about half of it and get a box. Everyone else... literally EVERYONE, got dessert except me and my mom and the girl running the party. 

The desserts were huge and beautiful and mouthwatering...except my mouth wasn’t really watering. I was still just full from my steak. 

My high horse got even higher though as everyone started digging in. I’ve NEVER been the person to make a healthy choice in a social situation and I did it. I was literally feeling so good about it. 

Don’t downvote me! I didn’t act snotty and I normally have super low self esteem thinking everyone is better than me so this was just an awesome deviation from the normal. I’m actually really nice in my head 99% of the time. 

I had a planned “treat” for when I got home (diet root beer and homemade whipped cream) and I didn’t even have it, I just went to bed. Never would have happened before.  

Today, I went to lunch with my husband and did the whole thing again and got the same high. 

I literally love keto and my takeaway is that I’m really a beautiful 132 lb butterfly waiting to come out, I’m not really addicted to sugar anymore and I finally understand the draw of a “healthy” lifestyle and attitude. 

TLDR: Ate keto in a social setting, felt better than everyone else. ",1

I realized I am more trying to justify needing the medicine because I feel bad for it rather than wanting medical advice (which should be left to my doctor). I will talk to my doctor and be more open minded on getting on a new medicine and ask her about therapy options. Thanks again!


We are trying for a baby. I've been fully pant based for a few months and have been working toward this life styled for more than a year now. Pretty much just eat a ton of veggies, beans, lentils, 2 fruits a day, and only spices and herbs for flavor (can't really handle any sort of processed foods like tahini, nut butters, spice mix).


That being said, I have extreme anxiety. For the last 4-5 months I was on Paxil, I loved it, and then I realized how bad it is for an expecting mom (and for any human really) and spent the last 2 months withdrawing. I have had some pretty terrible behavior (anger, grumpy) and anxiety after getting off it, but now I'm finally doing a bit better.


I still have crazy anxiety, OCD (diagnosed by several), and had tried meditation, exercise, and a variety of herbal remedies and they they do not help in this area of me life. What should I do now? I asked my doctor but is not as impressed by WFPB, or sees really an issue for a lot of these things. I do not have the means to switch to another doctor and she is great in other areas.


Is it better to stay away from any form of SSRI or anxiety medicine or is is better to get on a low dose of something that would be the safest for me and baby? TIA!",0

FIL is Japanese (we live in Japan) and is used to the standard 21st century japanese diet - meat in every dish, fried stuff, beer, only tiny side salads, sugar/salt used heavily in savory dishes. 

I cannot find any easily accessible articles or videos, no specialists that would help support him on a PBD, nothing. Googled everything under the sun in Japanese related to diabetes and a PBD and there isn’t one article. 

He just won’t listen to what we say, and the books available (translated big titles from Eng to JP) are far too dense for him to read. 

Does anyone have any resources or ideas? We’re new to eating WFPD, and while my whole family (in Aus) are joking they’ve ‘joined the cult’ along with us, FIL thinks he’s ‘too old to change anything’ and ignores any advice we give. Won’t eat flax, won’t cut down on meat, still drinks a glass of milk before bed every night...

-Most of The Cokes/drinks just taste awful,specially the ''zero calorie'' ones taste just vile.

Yogurt (dairy or dairy free) does not even come close. 

I know it’s not WFPB, but I recently got water kefir grains. I’m going to add some of the brewed kefir water to a whole milk alternative (ex: cashew milk, unstrained) to ferment it. There are a couple recipe sites where people had success with this.

I never liked water kefir because it was too sweet. I dislike all things coconut (people often make coconut kefir, water & milk). 

I eat other fermented vegetables (sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles). But nothing ever came close to the feeling or taste than milk kefir.

It sounds super weird but it made me feel so good.

I had zero problem giving up cheese, and all other dairy, except for this! It’s been about a year and I still think about it from time to time.

I don’t feel like I can ask a fermenting group bc they would just tell me to drink it anyways, and I’m not sure if asking anyone here would be appropriate.

First, [the photos](https://imgur.com/gallery/1n4cfhS), because that's what we all care about the most! (There are 3 images in the gallery.)

So, I was *not* expecting to reach this milestone this morning! I was still a couple of pounds away when I weighed in 2 days ago, so I figured I still had another couple of days to go. Coincidentally today is my 8 month keto anniversary! 

I started at 375 on Feb 26, and this morning the scale read 274!

**My story**

I have struggled with my weight for around 2 decades at this point. I've tried so many different ways to lose weight, but ultimately I had difficulty sticking to anything I tried. Much of this has to do with my ADHD -- I get excited about new things and can stick to them for short periods of time, but as soon as the newness wears off, or I get bored, I'm back to my old habits. 

The only time I had success was in 2003 when I started Atkins. It seemed to really work with my body and the weight melted off. I lost 52 lbs that go around. I eventually fell out of doing Atkins because I allowed myself to fall into the low carb product craze. I would eat a ton of low carb ice cream or candy and the cravings for sweet things would come rushing back. Eventually I found myself saying, ""I can have a little bit of real ice cream"" and then would finish off the tub. 

Over the next 14 years my weight [continued to climb](https://i.imgur.com/q2XzJLH.png). I had mild success, but would always gain the weight back, and then it would keep going up. 

Eventually I hit a point emotionally and mentally that I was done being fat. I mean, I had hit this point many times, but it was different this time. I didn't want to die prematurely and leave my two young kids without a father. I was tired of waking up with my back in pain. I was tired of being unattractive (I had also gotten divorced about a year and a half before starting keto).

So, I started keto, and that was the day my life changed forever. 

For some reason I was able to stick to it this time. It was easy. I love the food I eat, and I no longer crave sugar and carbs. I can turn down cookies and ice cream and candy with ease. For me, Keto was the answer. 

**How did I do it?**

Consistency, mostly. 

*Carbs* - I eat 20 grams of net carbs or less most days. The days I go over it is never more than 60 net grams, and I always get back on track the next day. 
    
*Tracking* - I track every single thing I eat. And I do it immediately after eating it, otherwise I'll forget about it and forget to track it. I've tracked 227 days in a row at this point. (Early on there were 4 days in a row where I didn't track right away, and eventually forgot what I had eaten those days, which is why my streak isn't a long as I've been doing keto.)
    
*Water* - I drink a ton of water, and I use Mio water enhancers to make it palatable. This helps keep me full when I'm in between meals. And keeps my hydrated. 
    
*Gum* - I chew a ton of sugar free gum. This helps when I'm craving something to chew on but am not hungry. 
    
*Simplicity* - I eat pretty much the exact same meals every single day. This makes it easy for me. Yeah, I could use more variety, but I enjoy what I eat, so it's not so bad. And I do add some variety on occasion, when I can afford a steak or when I have the time and motivation to make something more complicated. 
    
*Cravings* - I try to stay away from sweet things. I still indulge in sweet treats like sugar free Jello, as well as sugar free pudding, but if I eat these too often the cravings come on strong, and I go overboard -- especially on the pudding, since it has carbs. Now, I try to stay away from the pudding, because I know it's hard for me to eat just one. 
    
*Calories* - I keep my calories within a reasonable range. I know this one is a tad controversial here, since the idea is that with keto and high fat you naturally don't eat as much, so you shouldn't need to track your calories. That's how I did it for the first half, but I decided I wanted to speed up the process a little, and started keeping my calories below 2000 per day, on average over a week. Eventually I started lowering this number, and now I'm pretty consistently below 1800 per day on average. 

*Fat* - I try to eat at least 60% of my calories in fat. This keeps me more full throughout the day.
    
**What do I eat?**

I've found that sticking to the same meals every day is the easiest way for me to be successful. This is what a typical day looks like for me.

*Breakfast:*
- 8 strips of bacon
- 1 premiere chocolate protein shake
- mixed with 1 cup of unsweetened vanilla almond milk

*Lunch:*
- 1 quarter lb hamburger patty from Costco
- seasoned with Lawry's seasoning salt
- with 1 teaspoon of A1 steak sauce

*Dinner:*
- 1.5 quarter lb hamburger patties from Costco
- seasoned with Lawry's seasoning salt
- with 1 teaspoon of A1 steak sauce
- 2 cups unsweetened vanilla almond milk

*Snacks:*
- 2 polly-o string cheese
- 2 cups sugar free jello
- 2 cups unsweetened vanilla almond milk

I hope this was helpful for those of you just starting out, or those of you finding yourself in need of some extra motivation!

So I told my doc about my history of weight loss struggles. I told him I've tried to lose weight through simple calorie counting before, and he interrupted me: ""Have you ever heard of keto?""

I said I had. Then he started talking about the benefits of keto, and how it might be worth a try.

He said over the past five years, the patients he's had that have dropped significant weight and kept it off had two things in common: 1. Eating keto. 2. Lifting weights 2\-3 times a week on average.

I told him I'd been eating keto for three weeks, and he pulled out a piece of paper and wrote down a bunch of exercises \-\- Squats, Lunges, etc. \-\- he wanted me to do on a weekly basis. He said: In a year, I want you to be 20lbs lighter. And we'll keep knocking off 20lbs a year until you're at a healthy weight. I told him I was currently losing quite a bit more than that and asked if I should change anything. He said: ""Just your mindset. Don't worry about dropping the pounds as much. Worry about the habits and the health practices. You'll probably lose faster than 20lbs a year. But that's the goal I want to set.""

There is no doubt about that.

But being very honest. I started suffering from the heavy meat consumption, or high protein, in case of the carnivore.

The keto diet that best worked for me was a low protein ketogenic diet. So it was mostly vegetables, fat, and then some small piece of meat.

The small variety of vegetables i consume started damaging me in the long run, like they always do. So i went carnivore. And it was all good, until it wasnt.

The people in my situation tend to be very afraid to even look back at certain foods. Because the suffering was enormous, and our life was in danger. And in some situations the lives of others around you that depend on you.

So its super risky, to even think you can go back eating some things.

But anyways. Now lets get to the point.

I can only eat rice, corn and fruits safely in the long run. And i need to abstain from meat and protein for as long as possible at the moment.

I can handle it, as long as necessary.

Another problem is i dont tolerate supplements of any kind. They dont seem to do anything to me, and they only make me feel nauseated and sick in the stomach.

So yes, im doing plant based without supplements.

So the big question is. How long can i go on my plant based diet without vitamin b12 supplementation?

To give you an idea of why this is pissing me off, look at how this single food (bacon) represents the whole of /r/keto compared to an entire food *group* which is actually essential in a Western diet:

Community search for ""[bacon](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/search?q=bacon&restrict_sr=on)"" - 2280 hits

I bought a crap scale and weighed myself at 351lbs. For that month I tried eating well, or what I thought was ""well"", but on November 1st I officially started Keto. It was a long process trying to figure out my body - I lacked on electrolytes, I ate too much fat, I tried to incorporate exercise way too quickly, and I struggled to find ways to force myself to drink water. Now I make 2 28oz and 2 32oz ketoades in different MiO flavors every day, I only eat fats as toppings or cooking oils and I took a break from my home gym until I lose a few more lbs. One meal a day is something I never though was possible either.

After a particularly difficult evening (because of unrelated events), I found myself not wanting my OMAD last night as usual and I went to bed at 9pm. Enter several fragmented dreams about me breaking my Keto diet, eating pieces of toast and realizing in my dream only a second later that, ""hey, this is toast!!! I can't eat this!!!"" Thankfully I woke up toast-less, carb-less, and feeling glad I didn't break my 134 day streak.

For the last two weeks I've been gaining and losing the same 2 pounds and although it hasn't deterred my confidence in Keto, it has certainly been frustrating and a bit dampening on the ole mood because I have been teetering between 305-303lbs... so close from Twotopia. 

I woke up this morning, still in a rut about the events of last night, only to weigh myself and see 299.6lbs. 

I immediately burst into tears and looked at my new body, with a total of 52lbs lost since November 1st, 2017, and I am so overwhelmed with happiness that my dedication is showing and that this WOE is maintainable and not painful - it is the best thing I've ever done. Thank you Keto community, without your before and after photos to encourage me and without your sage advice I would not be on this subreddit expressing my emotions..

I had lost hope. I accepted that I would be fat forever. My journey is far from over, but 50lbs in 4.5 months compared to 0lbs lost in 29 years? Folks, Keto works. Don't listen to the naysayers. Take it from people who actually have found results. YOU. CAN. DO. THIS. It's so easy once you've decided that food can no longer have a hold on you.

I'm so proud of everyone in this subreddit and so proud of you out there who decide that TODAY is the DAY. Seriously, you will never, ever regret it.

Here's to my next post at Onederland... :')

**EDIT:**

First of all, thank you to everyone for such kind, supportive words. What started out as a milestone for me, making this thread at 50lbs lost, became a outreach of love and empathy and I am floored at the response I've received today. Let this post be a marker in my journey for me to refer back to fondly when I'm at the end of my journey as a representation of my perseverance and how all of you were with me every step of the way. Thank you r/keto for not letting me down. Much love and support from my full heart in all of your journeys as well. KCKO!

**2nd edit**

For the sake of those who get to twotopia and onederland, although I just hit 299.6 yesterday, I came back to 301 today. Just cause you reach twotopia doesn't mean you stay there permanently, I still need a day or two or three to officially not have to worry about seeing the dreaded 3!

&#x200B;

English isn't my native language so I'm sorry for any mistakes I make. Brace yourself, long post ahead.

&#x200B;

**Back story**

I've always had a normal BMI. I remember graduating High school 115 pounds (52 kg). A close friend back then introduced me to pizza, pasta and all kinds of high carb food that were uncommon in my household. So naturally I gained a few pounds, I was around 136 pounds (62 kg) but I actually enjoyed the way I look - I got nice round thighs and cute butt. I stayed the same weight for the next four years.

&#x200B;

**The weight gain**

2013 turned out to be awful for me. I went on a 3 month exchange program in the States and had horrible experience. When I came back home the bad memories triggered depression, anxiety and panic attacks. I was consulted by psychiatrist after psychiatrist and no one seemed to take me seriously and see that I have a problem. All they did was prescribe new meds or change how much should I take. The drugs didn't help so after 6 months I decided I had enough. I stopped taking my pills and started battling depression on my own. For the next two to three months I gained around 30 pounds (13 kg) without changing my diet or having extreme cravings.

&#x200B;

**The wake-up call**

I did try to lose weight. Maybe at first I was in denial how I look and how heavy I was because despite the extra pounds I still had the skinny girl mentality. My confidence didn't suffer at all I was still feeling sexy and beautiful. And then when I went shopping, I'll always pick sizes too small for me and be sad looking at my image in the changing room. I really wish that was the wake up call or the lack of intimacy in my relationship but it got worse actually. Despite hitting the gym for almost a year and being careful with what I eat, I didn't lose a single pound. In 2016 I was diagnosed with metabolic syndrome, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and in March 2018 after a check up I was told I'm prediabetic. And that was scary. I was prescribed a metformin type of medicine and was told I must lose weight. But no one bothered to tell me how exactly. My doctor told me to stop eating sweets, bread and drink coke. The irony is that I dislike sweets, don't eat bread and find the taste of coke nasty. So the advice was to change nothing, take my pills and hope for a miracle.

&#x200B;

**The change**

On a different sub someone mentioned that IF helped them lose weight. I didn't know what IF was. I've always been taught that skipping meals is bad and my body will go into starvation mode. Or that my metabolism will slow down. My mom was telling me how I should eat 6 small meals a day. Surprisingly she's in a really good shape following her own advice. Usually I have difficulty eating in the morning, so skipping breakfast and just having black coffee seemed doable. So mid-March 2018 I started eating from 12 to 7 pm, two meals a day. The first week was tough - listening to the tigers fighting in my stomach was quite embarrassing at work. Now not eating in the morning is the most natural thing for me.

&#x200B;

**Keto**

IF helped me lose 11 pounds (5 kg) in 6 weeks (not sure how the weight loss was influenced by the pills I was taking). I was happy but I felt like I wasn't doing enough. Then I saw a post in r/intermittentfasting how keto and IF go so well together. Plus keto had addition pros like improving ones mental state and I could really benefit from that. I was already eating lower carb so I decided to fully commit in the beginning of May 2018. I've read everything about the diet, bookmarked a ton of recipes and full prepared to suffer the keto fly. Which never actually hit me.

&#x200B;

**Macros**

Closely tracking my food was difficult. I've tried several apps but putting the amount of food I ate gave me so much anxiety that I quickly quit. Instead I found googling the nutritional values per 100 g of something so much easier and stress-free. Even before keto I loved meal prepping so now once a week I'll measure the food, cook two or three dishes depending on my budget and then portion it into boxes for lunch and dinner. Although I did know how much calories I should consume I mostly ate until satiated. Which often led to OMAD (and a lot of frozen premade meals). During the first month I learnt the hard way I need more potassium and magnesium after my legs started cramping. I took the supplements for a week and then stopped. I'm feel great ever since.

&#x200B;

**Plateaus**

I've read so many people complaining they stopped losing weight. For me plateaus were a blessing because it meant I could lose a certain amount and actually maintain that current weight instead of going backwards. In my experience the easiest way to break plateau is a longer fast - 36 or 48 hours (I do know that is not for everyone). But plateau definitely something I don't stress about. Being short, I can actually see in the mirror the difference every kg makes and take this time to get used to the new me.

&#x200B;

**Cravings**

As I mentioned, I don't like sweets like chocolate or cake, so in that department I was good. I don't cook keto versions of carby foods. The only thing I miss are potatoes, chips in particular. But lately I've notices I actually crave the salt and the crunch not the potato itself. Eating something keto friendly with extra salt does the trick (pickles are a blessing). During the summer I had a cheat meal at a wedding. Without drinking alcohol I had the worst handover/brain fog in my life the next day. It's not worth it guys, eat some bacon when you have a craving, your body will thank you later.

&#x200B;

**Pros**

\- Losing the weight - I'm no longer prediabetic, my blood tests are perfect;

\- Feeling normal; Reduces to non-existent anxiety  - Before keto feeling stressed and anxious was the norm, now being ""just fine"" is the best thing ever. I'm not overly happy or ecstatic, I feel like myself 

\- A lot more energy, no longer feeling sleepy after a meal;

\- No brain fog;

\- Less hair loss and a lot of new baby hair;

\- I sweat less;

&#x200B;

**Cons**

\- Dealing with annoying people who are uneducated and overly-concerned about my eating habits;

\- Buying new clothes if that even counts as a con (I really hate shopping);

\- With the change of seasons where I live, I feel colder than usual;

&#x200B;

**What stayed the same**

\- My skin is the same but I've never had issues to begin with;

\- My period is still regular - I was hoping it'll get less painful but oh well...;

&#x200B;

**In conclusion**

Keto quickly turned from a diet to a way of life. I'll continue eating low carb because it's no longer about the weight loss or the weight maintenance, it's about this new state of mind that I have. I love waking up rested before my alarm goes off. I love feeling calm and collected and not being afraid of the day ahead. I love how changing my diet gave me control of my life.

I can't express how grateful I am that this sub exists. Now my favorite part of the day is reading your amazing and inspirational stories with my morning coffee. Don't give up if you're struggling with plateaus or people not being supportive. Recalculate your macros every 10 pounds or so, try and educate the ones close to you. It's all worth it in the end, being the best version of yourself.

&#x200B;

Been on keto for three weeks now and i feel like i'm eating to little.,0,169atc,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/169atc/been_on_keto_for_three_weeks_now_and_i_feel_like/,6,1357781524.0,"Hi, let me start out by saying this is an awesome subreddit (except for all the drama that has been going on lately, which am not really well informed about because i hate drama and i avoided every submission about this whole thing). I've been on keto for three weeks know going into my first month. I started at 225-227ish and i'm about 209 know. Through out this whole time I've been on a diet of eggs, chicken, turkey, salmon, cheese sticks (my first week), some nuts, and greens (this week). Some days i eat about 1,200 calories, and some i eat 400-800 calories. I don't eat crazy amounts of fat and red meat and fat (my fat mostly comes form eggs and chicken, and sometimes almonds). My daily carb intake is between 5-15 grams, but mostly below 10 grams. I walk for about 8 hours a day because a work at a warehouse but i don't sweat a lot so i don't know if that does anything. I will hopefully start lifting weights and a little cardio in the next few days.

My problem is this. I signed up to myfitnesspal today and it told my that i should aim at 2110 calories. Today for breakfast i had some sun flower seeds and the zero calories half and half Arizona ( which i'm addicted to know, and i feel like it might be healthier than a diet soda but i'm not sure but i would like your input.). Myfitnesspal said this is too little(I know that) and I should aim at a daily intake of about 1200 calories or my body will go into starvation mode and it will be hard to lose weight. I was only planning on eating some turkey for lunch and maybe another Arizona, but i don't think this gets me to 1200 calories for the day.

I like the way I eat know and i don't feel like drastically changing it. I think i might eat a few snacks here and there to get to 1200 calories but will that be enough. I like the snack size blue diamond almonds which are about 220 calories each but 3-4 grams of carbs and i don't like getting above 10 grams.

i'm sorry for this long rant ( it used to take me a week to write a 1200 word analysis paper for the books we read in my college english class but i wrote this rant in 5 minutes), but i really want to lose weight and i like the way i eat.

So my question is: Will i be ok if i eat about 1200 calories a day.

If you read this whole thing thank you and i hope you respond with your input.",1

New to this sub, mainly live on r/loseit

After intermittent fasting and cico for a few weeks i've wound up doing a complete water fast for the past 48 hours. 
It's sort of been accidental but after doing a bit of reading i've decided to transition from the fast into a keto diet. 

I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to maximise my transition. 
Am i best off hold onto the fast for another day or 2 (which i feel i can do pretty easily) to put me straight into Ketosis or am i better off introducing fat now? 

A big part of me wants to see how long i can keep this fast up, as a bit of a personal challenge but if i'm wasting time that i could be getting ahead on keto then i'll stop. 

Thanks alot guys

Best Practices For Testing Foods For Therapeutic & General Ketosis? GKI vs. BG?,0,bcyopm,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/bcyopm/best_practices_for_testing_foods_for_therapeutic/,4,1555240738.0,"Question in short: What is the best process for testing different foods to see their effect on your ketones and if they will 'kick you out'? E.g. Erythitol v. Sucralose v. Xylitol, etc. I understand ketones do not matter to weightloss (don't necessarily care about that), but for me they seem to correlate with solving my mental/emotional medical issues when I am at higher levels (around 4-5mmol give or take). But I really need 'food flexibility' so I am not entirely beholden to eating at home everynight. 

&#x200B;

Furthermore, I don't trust any nutrition labels and just want to check out if I can eat them without a severe effect (e.g. Killer Creamery Erythitol ice cream). I'm also doing this for determining a more accurate 'carb limit' and what is the best indicator? I've used GKI, BG, and ketone mmol but I hear 'anything under 15 bg spike is safe' to 'anything under 30'. Are there any general guidelines for this? Is GKI best? MMOL best? Testing day after levels at the same time consistently? My eating and life habits are extremely disciplined so this could help since I know fluctuation is wild. 

&#x200B;

Background: I've been in Ketosis roughly for half a year and have noticed marked improvements in mental health, emotions, and with an inflammatory disease I suffer from when my ketones are relatively high (e.g. \~5mmol).  When does fat adaptation occur by the way? This is one thing I have never ever heard a straight answer on?

&#x200B;

My intention: to continue Ketosis as a lifestyle (shockingly agreed to by my doctors) but would like to start reincorporating 'Normal'ish foods besides the meat and cheese I exclusively eat now so I can start socially eating again and have a more sustainable diet going forward where I can look forward to things and perhaps even allowing myself 'dirty keto'. Life has just become very bland eating steak every single meal.

&#x200B;

I'm also speaking with doctor about getting a Freestyle continuous monitor to help with and any thoughts on that would be appreciated.

&#x200B;

I really hope to hear some of your thoughts and not the 'eat under 20 a day and don't worry about it. I don't do ketosis for weight loss necessarily, and I eat under 20 a day religiously, fast regularly, and I'm just interested to see if anyone else has any experience with and hope to be able to reintroduce some foods to create a more flexible long term lifestyle!

As the title suggests, I have a question about blenders/food processors. I've been mostly WFPB for about 2 years, but have only fully committed to an entirely WFPB vegan diet for the past 3 or 4 months. As a result, I'm looking at expanding my repertoire and trying out some new recipes as well as improving upon the ones I've been using. 

I have an immersion blender that is maybe 10 years old haha it still works great, but does get overheated quickly if I try to blend frozen fruit without thawing it significantly first or using a lot of liquid. It can take a few minutes of blending and then letting the immersion blender rest/cool off before I get a smooth result. 

I'm wondering whether a blender or a food processor would be best for me. I live alone so I don't need a huge ol thing. It would mostly be for delicious smoothies w frozen fruits and frozen bananas (I don't really use ice). I'm curious about venturing into making cashew cream and possibly nut butters myself as well if possible. I'll keep using my immersion blender for soups and such. 

What wattage do you recommend for a machine that will be powerful enough? I know I can't get a high-speed blender like a vitamix or blendtec, and that I'll have to modify some recipes to compensate for that (like soaking cashews overnight first), but I feel like a regular 250W blender or a cheap food processor still wouldn't been powerful enough. That's why I'm turning to you guys to see what your experiences have been and what you have used & enjoyed. 

 I'm also on a tight budget as I'm a student and I'm not currently working, so I'm fully reliant on student loans. I've been saving up and my max price is 80 for now, although I could wait until I have put a bit more aside.

Anyway, I appreciate any and all advice! Thanks for taking the time to read this whole thing. It turned out a bit longer than I had anticipated! 😋",0

I was diagnosed the 9th of july with A HBA1C of 6.1% (so prediabetic) and a fasting glucose of 1.2 g.L^-1, high level of feretin (iron) and other issues. After a bit of fumbling, I started keto and IF OMAD. Yesterday I had to test again to see if it got better and it did !
Here are the result: https://imgur.com/a/puTKdpY

Pretty incredible. Dropped from 117 kg to 84 today (257 lbs to 185 lbs), the doctor was impressed by how much I lost, but when I described how I lost it, she was not happy and told me to eat carb (whole grain rice, pasta and bread) at least once a day.  
If you don't want to click, my HB1Ac is now 4.9% so perfectly healthy and blood sugar is 0.7 but I couldn't eat the night before the test because I was working so it's a bit low.

Very happy about my result!",1

Blood work question,2,jgbuab,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jgbuab/blood_work_question/,8,1603440191.0,Hi so I have been on Keto since Late July . Dropped about 26-28 pounds so far . Ended up taking 5 days on vacation and may have not done the best but had a fasting blood work panel three  days later . I normally fast anyways but had been fasting for about 16 hours . I was shocked to see my triglycerides came back at 618 and elevated liver at 50 which isn’t as off as the triglycerides are. I know I saw something in the faq about this but this just seems awfully high for three months in and such . My doctor knows I’m on keto and is actually one who advocates but still was asked to come test again and look at options .  Any thoughts ? I feel better than I did pre keto .,1

Been within the 0.6-1.1mmol since switching to low carb, so still maintaining some form of ketosis.

My first bloodwork was performed the month before I began keto:

**Dec. 2017**:

Total Cholesterol: 216

HDL: 44

TRIG: 88

LDL 154

Trig/HDL ratio: 2

My second bloodwork was in **May 2018**, just 5 months after I started keto:

Total Cholesterol:  233

HDL: 53

TRIG: 179

LDL: 149

Trig/HDL ratio: 3.37

My third bloodwork was in **October 2018**, just 10 months after I started keto.  Though I misplaced those lab results, my Trig/HDL ratio was 2.24.

In **June 2020**, I went to low carb.  I recently had my bloodwork run this month (**October 2020**)and the LDL results were concerning:

Total Cholesterol: 276

HDL: 53

TRIG: 75

LDL: 208

Trig/HDL ratio: 1.42

As you can see, the Trig/HDL ratio has been on a steady decline, which, according to the Keto FAQ, is great... However, my LDL has skyrocketed from 154 to 208, which is a bit concerning.  The FAQ states that particle size is really the issue, however, my bloodwork doesn't account for particulate size.  My PCP wants to put me on cholesterol medication, which I am vehemently against if unnecessary...  

I'm going back on hard keto (>20g carbs/day) for the next three months before my lab tests.  I told my doctor that I would push any consideration of medication until after 3-month bloodwork lab results and 6-month bloodwork lab results.

Does anyone have any insight to these results, perhaps other blood work lab tests I should ask for in my 3-month and 6-month follow ups?  I would like to do this naturally, if at all possible, but the LDL is concerning, however, I know that many people say to ignore LDL altogether... however, my PCP refuses to do so.",1

Within 4 months I went from 288lbs to 258lbs.  And the glory of his ketones were in me and in my urine.  But then I began to doubt.  You see brothers and sisters I hit a hard and long plateau.  I yoyo’d up and down in the 250s from September of 2018 to April of 2019.  I was losing the faith.

It’s easy, brothers and sisters.  It’s easy to believe when the weight is coming off and the compliments are coming.  It’s HARD, brothers and sisters.  It’s hard when the weight isn’t coming off and you’re still saying “no thank you” when people offer that doughnut or that slice of pizza.  It’s hard to sit with friends and have a water while they enjoy brews.  But the way of the keto is not for person who can only see the path in front of them.  I said The Way Of The Keto is NOT for the person who can only see the path in front of them!  

At the end of April, the plateau ended and saw me into the 240s.  My faith may have been tested but in the end I passed the test.  I kept the faith.  Now I’m at 244.6.  I know I will be tested again brothers and sisters.  It’s coming.  The path is different for us all.  Mine is a long one.  But I will endure.  And someday I too will enter the promised onederland.  

I would like to take a moment and encourage all who seek the ketones of blessedness.  Do not trust the scale at your feet, nor the ketones on your piss test.  Trust the process the Great Keto has lain for you.  Your path may not be the easiest.  But I assure you it’s worth it.

So I need some professional advice; would it just be best to forgo the apples until I'm at an acceptable weight,  or would a little apple be something I could overlook with enough daily exercise?

CICO is NOT the Deciding Factor in Weight Loss. Let Me Explain with Real-Life Example.,0,9c2s0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9c2s0u/cico_is_not_the_deciding_factor_in_weight_loss/,35,1535834735.0,"CICO (calories in/ calories out) is NOT the deciding factor, but hormones are. You can eat twice as many calories and still lose weight if you suppress insulin.  A naturally thin person's metabolism will speed up to burn off extra calories, even more than an extra thousand a day. They're insulin regulation works that way. Other people will store it as fat. So fluctuating hormone levels or stalled ones, inhibit quite a few of us.

For instance, I went down to 600 calories a day trying to lose weight (On and off for years). Sure I lost a few pounds but it wasn't sustainable and all it did was slow down my metabolism! When I went ""up"" to maintenance level calories of 1,200 which technically were still a deficit for my age, height, weight, and activity level—I would gain weight!

On IF and Keto, I am eating 1,200 calories a day, TWICE the amount of a CICO diet with no change in anything but keeping carbs under 20 net grams of carbs, and I lose weight! Talk about happy. :) I know I can go back to 1750 calories or slightly more when I am in maintenance and keeping carbs low, and I won't gain. If I eat what should be ""normal"" (the 1,750 cal) with carbs, I will gain weight fast. It's insulin, baby.

THE only difference was eliminating carbs and eating some fat at meals so I stay full. Activity level didn't change, only my hormone insulin edited: was suppressed.  

Edited to add: No, it's not still CICO. **1,200 calories mainly carbs, I gain weight. 1,200 calories in ketosis, I lose weight. Calories did not change. Exercise level did not change. Insulin response changed with the addition of carbs; that is all.**

Many researchers have confirmed this. Including Dr. Jason Fung. ",1
CICO is not my God.,298,64sq7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/64sq7t/cico_is_not_my_god/,175,1491964382.0,"Calories in vs calories out (CICO)  is often proclaimed as the reason that a person loses or gains weight while on a diet, but I'm not completely convinced by this theory. Yes, I have a basic understanding of the law of thermodynamics and how it relates to this issue, but I believe that there are several other factors that play a big part in losing or gaining weight.

First off, I don't believe that a calorie consumed and a calorie absorbed are the same thing. We know of at least one type of molecule that is technically food and contains calories, but when eaten produces much less energy than would be expected as the human body is not capable (at least not fully) of digesting the molecule and absorbing it's calories: fiber. Fiber is a carbohydrate, meaning that it is essentially made up of sugar molecules, which are is the most basic form of energy that our body can use, but due to the structure of fiber molecules, our body is incapable of absorbing more than a fraction of the available energy that the molecule holds. The amount of calories extracted from a gram of fiber may also vary from person to person. Most people know that there are soluble and insoluble fibers, but there are actually a lot of sub types of fiber as well. The amount of energy that is extracted from a gram of fiber is highly dependent upon the type of fiber and the types of bacteria contained in the gut. Because everyone's gut biome is a little different, the amount of energy absorbed vs consumed can be quite variable. 

Fiber isn't the only type of molecule that is absorbed differently by different people either. Those with lactose intolerance have trouble digesting lactose, a type of sugar found in milk. I would argue that lactose intolerance is not a disorder, as most mammals lose the ability to digest lactose after they stop nursing and subsequently stop producing an enzyme called lactase which allows for lactose digestion. Adult lactase production is actually a mutation in humans and is more common within certain ethnicities. In short if two people with different ethnic backgrounds consume an equal amount of milk, the amount of calories actually absorbed by their bodies might be very different between the two.

The calories in vs calories out philosophy oversimplifies a complex issue, but I know the response of CICO proponents, that ""calories in"" means calories absorbed, not just consumed, and to this I would argue that there are not many people out there that just want to weigh less. Most normal people on a diet have goals such as looking better or just being healthier. The phrase ""losing weight"" has become somewhat synonymous with looking better or getting healthy, but ""weight"" isn't the real issue, body fat is.
Body fat is what makes us fat, or what most people think of as ""overweight,"" and unhealthy. If your goal is simply to lose weight, then you might not mind losing a few pounds of muscle and the CICO method may work for you. But, if your goal is to look better or be healthier (a much better goal than just weighing less) then you should try to retain as much muscle as possible while cutting down on body fat in order to maintain your strength and appearance. CICO is a principle related to weight loss, not body fat reduction, and is therefore not a beneficial approach to looking or feeling better, or what most people think about when they say or hear the phrase ""losing weight.""

What you put in your body is more important than than how much of it. Sure you need to eat less to lose more, that is common sense. But if you were to eat 90% carbs at a 100 calorie deficit vs taking a keto approach at a 100 calorie deficit you may weigh the same after a month, but you would probably be a lot more happy with the keto results due to losing more fat and retaining more muscle than you would have on a high carb approach. 

Furthermore, since you are retaining more muscle on keto, and more muscle means a higher TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) then over time you will be able to eat more calories than someone just following a CICO approach and still lose the same amount of weight. Meaning if there was a set of identical twins that weighed the same, had the exact same body composition and had a TDEE of 2000 calories each, if one decided to eat only twinkies and junk food at 1900 calories a day, while the other ate keto at 1900 calories a day, then yeah they would both lose weight, but at the end of a month their TDEEs would be different as their body compositions would have become different. Maybe the junk food twin lost 5 lbs but their TDEE is now 1900, whereas the keto twin also lost 5 lbs, but retained more muscle and now has a TDEE of 1950. Now if the twins wanted to continue losing weight at the same rate the junk food twin would have to consume 50 calories less than the keto twin. This may be an extreme example, but it demonstrates the flaws in the CICO mentality that all calories are equal.

Tl:Dr A CICO approach oversimplifies things, doesn't account for individual variation, and is a ""weight loss"" guideline while body fat reduction (not weight loss) should be the goal of your diet.",1

A week in and feeling good so far, lost about 5 or 6 pounds (trying not to weigh myself too regularly otherwise it bums me out if the scale hasn’t changed). not quite doing Keto yet, just low carb to start with while I get used to tracking my macros again accurately (not accounting for carbs in the veggies I’m eating etc). Aiming for 30-40g carbs limit at the moment, will reduce to 20g soon when I am more in the swing of things, hopefully starting Monday next week. Currently I am not eating any form of added carb in any meal but I am being lazy and not accounting for the carbs I consume in my vegetables, which are dark leafy greens and cauliflower, broccoli etc. hence why I’m calling it low carb not keto. I know it does all add up. 

however I have a question, I’m going away for the weekend and staying with a friend. i Know it’s possible to stay low carb if I’m super careful but as it’s her birthday I can’t promise I’ll stick to it, especially as I can’t cook my own meals so I won’t know what’s going in. The only thing I can definitely stick to is my calorie deficit. 

my question is should I try and go low carb for the weekend (as in increase to around 50g) but not worry about staying in Ketosis (Which Im not in yet anyway) or does it not matter if I include some healthy carbs as long as it’s under my calorie intake for the day? as my carb limit is quite high at the moment I’m probably not even fat adapted yet anyway so I’m wondering which will be the best way to keep losing weight over the weekend. I’m not too sure about the science-y side of it but I’m assuming as long as I keep eating healthy and stick to my calorie limit surely I will still lose weight right? 

im not talking about going crazy and binging on pizza etc, I’m just talking about still eating healthy but worrying less about my macros for these couple of days and being More conscious of calories. This will be my last weekend seeing friends and family before Christmas so I know I can get straight back to it when I’m back but I’m worried about ruining my progress so far.

I want to give keto a try, because I do have some weight that I want to kick to the curb. 

That being said, is it possible to go keto for a few months and then scale back off it without too much weight gain? I know that I can handle the diet change in the short term, and I'm more than willing to do so in order to get to a healthier weight. At the same time, there are things that I just do not want to restrict myself from having in the long term. 

Alcohol, for example. I know that light liquids are allowed, but I don't really enjoy a vodka soda or gin and tonic (or flavored variations thereof). I don't drink primarily to get drunk. I drink because I like to have a beer or a manhattan that tastes good and that allows me to enjoy socializing with others. 

And it's not just alcohol. There are foods that I don't want to part with forever. I know that keto is a lifestyle and comes with many challenges at the beginning. I'm willing to face these challenges. But once I drop the pounds that I want to drop, is it okay to switch to a relatively low calorie diet without a huge weight gain?

I just feel like we are sending the wrong message to beginners / less informed by high-fiving people for bragging about how many strips of bacon they used (or whatever). If you're trying to lose weight, it's still calories in vs. calories out. Keto is a tool, it is not a free pass to eat as much as you want so long as you don't eat any carbs. If you can fit 30 strips of bacon in your diet, kudos to you. But applauding a 'more is better' mentality sets a dangerous precedent for beginners IMO.

And yet, I feel like I see this behavior all the time, from the standpoint of an OP that goes ""[FP] X Y Z ingredients. 14 strips!!!"" => 14 billion upvotes. It's like we're saying ""cheers mate, you just did with 14 strips of bacon what could have been done with 10. well done! here's 200 bonus calories, a slap on the back, oh, and a strip of bacon.""

Keto isn't about how many strips of bacon you can pound in a day, nor is it about pushing the limits of what non-ketoers perceive as ""unhealthy.""

What carb surprises have you had (good or bad) since starting Keto?   
Pease tell me everything I don't yet know! 

**1) SweetNLow**

The biggest shock of all: SweetNLow has sugar in it. Dextrose to be specific.

""Sweet'N Low zero calorie sweetener contains about 0.9 gram of carbohydrates per 1 gram packet."" There it is, plain as day on their website.

.9 grams per packet! I have \~ 6 packets per day. 1 with morning coffee. 2 with each iced tea. 1 with evening decaf.

That's more than 4 grams of carbs each day! Given my 20 grams carb budget, that's HUGE.

How did I not know this?

Thank you to whoever mentioned it recently here in and different thread. I didn't believe it at first. But it's right there on their website FAQ.

I did try the liquid form they claim has zero carbs. It's BTN (Better Than Nothing). Not as good as the pink packets.

**2) Meatballs**

A) Whole Foods Italian meatballs. Purchased from the SF deli counter when no time to cook. Didn't realize they were loaded with carbs till Cronometer iphone app told me they were.

B) OK so I decided make my own meatballs from my fave Anne Burrell meatball recipe.

Problem: Wasn't sure what to use for bread crumbs.

Decided on pecan meal that I had picked up from my local pecan store assuming of course PECAN MEAL would be mostly OK. It had dextrose too! I made the entire recipe before realizing it. So much $ and time wasted.

Lesson: Ask for the ingredient label at WF before purchasing. Read the ingredient labels when I cook! Sneaky carbs are everywhere!

I'll include the link to the pecan store, 38 Pecans, since their regular pecans are truly delicious and the business is a kind, local mom & pop type place almost totally online now. Texas pecan farmers all seem to be retired dentists. :-)

**3) Liquor**

This was a good carb surprise. Would never have guessed that some liquors have zero carbs.

""Pure spirits like whiskey, brandy, cognac, vodka, gin, and tequila contain zero carbs and are all fine on keto.""

The ironic thing is - I had switched to an excellent non-alcoholic beer (Clausthaler)

I don't care about the 'buzz'. I just like the taste of beer and wine as a special alternative to my water, coffee, tea routine.

So I started drinking Clausthaler since the research now basically says, alcohol is not good for you. Period. Have as little as possible.

However, I stopped that too because it has too many carbs.

Plan B:

Picked up some Michelob Ultra (2.6 carb grams per bottle) for when I feel like I really really want something else besides tea with a meal. Haven't tried it yet.

I haven't looked into low carb wines yet but I'm aware they exist.

Also, I'm happy to see that the non-alcoholic gin-alternative I bought (have not tried) has < 1 carb. Was worried it would have a ton.",1

This was to remove the temptation to prematurely celebrate success. Instead of giving people the reward/congratulations at the start, do it once a milestone has been achieved.

I bring this up as I see more posts with a theme of, ""Just started Keto"". This community is very supportive and I think that's awesome ... but giving gold to someone who is literally on day 1 of keto may not help them long term. Instead of giving gold/congrats we would be doing the person a favour to have an ethos, ""offer congrats for milestones"".

Today I am joyful, because I am celebrating my 4 year anniversary on Keto. I spent the morning doing some breakfast prep, working through my physical therapy exercises while the noms baked, and then enjoying that breakfast with a cup of coffee and a postal service record. 
Fibromyalgia is a pain I deal with every day. However, each day I choose to eat without sugar, bad carbs and starches, and each day I get my body moving, that pain can be managed. 
Mental health is a struggle every day. I deal with attention deficit and anxiety and this winter in particular, seasonal affective disorder (aka winter depression). Each day I cook with the music on, I make a choice to ignite my creativity and keep the (lazy mind inducing) Netflix off. When I cook balanced meals and keep my portions controlled, I continue to manage my weight and overall health. This escalates my confidence and keeps my mind clear and objective.
I am thankful to the Keto Reddit community for being there for me in the early days/weeks/months when I didn't know what the eff I was doing, to (my husband) Peter for suggesting this lifestyle after hearing about it on Reddit - and then providing constant support and encouragement throughout these four years, and to my friends and family for being supportive by never pressuring me to stop eating this way and to make frequent accommodations during events and family meals so I could feel included.
Keto is not a fad diet to lose weight, for me and other long term keto-ers, it is a lifestyle choice/change. It's the best choice I've ever made for myself. But I have to make these choices every day, over and over again. It is not easy. But every day, every meal, I choose keto... I am joyful.

I've inspired friends and family get started on their journeys, and helped them through it as well.

I gained so much when I lost the weight. Confidence, a stronger sense of self-worth, a better relationship with food, self-control, and most importantly; happiness with who I am. It gets hard sometimes, but if you've already started, you owe it to yourself to stay with it. If I can do this, you *definitely* can. Stay with it, and if you slip up, don't let that ruin your progress by giving up.

Long story why it is imperative for me to eat the same stuff as family (most peer pressure) but I will be right on track after this trip because I feel awful.

I fasted all day then I ate a high starch meal with a chocolate dessert 4 hours ago. Now, I am extremely thirsty and had to pee every 20 minutes. My body feels all hot and my skin suddenly went from moisturized to dry and scaly.

What the heck? I was clear and do not have diabetes (only borderline blood glucose levels via test) when I was 225 lbs. Why do I feel so awful after ingesting ~250 grams of carbs in one meal after fasting all day? Could it be that being adapted to keto made me less tolerant of carbs?

I am taking it easy on myself to start - eating as much as I want while keeping my macros in line.

I started measuring everything and now eyeball a lot of stuff. I am confident in my carb intake, I have been allowing fat and protein to blow over my calcs if I'm still hungry.

My targets are 33g carb, 205g fat, 165g protein. I'm eating meat, fish, dairy and lots of fiber (mostly from flax, chia, avocado as well as my carefully measured other veg). I'm doing IF, eating between noon and 8pm

One of my concerns was adapting to less vegetables. My prior diet was super high in veg - I would eat a big plate of seasoned cauliflower or broccoli to stay satisfied between meals and obviously can't do that anymore! I also gave up a high legume intake, my diet was pretty high quality prior to keto.

I am maintaining my weight, never feel deprived, and want some ideas on where to go from here. I am feeling really good so far. I'm interested in long term changes to my diet, not anything I can't maintain indefinitely.

Trying to lose weight in the past I can't handle being hungry week after week. Eventually I end up gaining if I try to maintain a deficit. If I don't eat I still get really hungry, not sure why my hunger is still strong on keto.

I'm doing lots of hiking daily and some basic bodyweight exercises. I could probably add to my regimen but don't like lifting weights. My muscles hurt and don't seem to get stronger but it has always been that way.

I was expecting more drastic results and would like some ideas on how to proceed.",1

The alcoholism, the binge eating, the food addiction - none of it was doing me any favors physically and mentally. 

At a towering 5'3"", I was just a few baskets of french fries away from 200 lbs. I was unhappy with myself and my body and knew that the only person who could change that was ME. So I woke up, kicked the bottle, cut out the carbs and sugars, and focused on my ultimate glow up.

 \-55 lbs later and here I am, a new life where I am finally in control of what I eat, how much I eat, and when I eat. The flicker of fast food signs no longer have their pull on me. Keto helped me kick the sugar addiction and become comfortable with my eating habits. I finally found a WOE that worked for ME. I ignored the naysayers and stayed focused. I did my research, I sacrificed, I learned self discipline. 

Here's to a new start, a new year, a new decade of positive changes. I'm rooting for you!

I was wondering if there is some kind of Tofu that is firm and chewy in texture, similar to meat.

I absolutely love the high protein amount, versatility of it as a food and I adore how well it takes flavor / fits into such a huge range of dishes but I really really miss the texture of meat.

The toughest Tofu I could find in my local store had a firmness somewhere between Feta and Omelette which is way too soft for what I'm looking for.

I'm also curious how much I can trust the carbs listed on websites like these.
It says it is 17 carbs per serving and 5 servings a recipe, but I used to eat half of it at a time. I'm doing about 20 carbs a day and this is my second week. I know the test strips aren't considered accurate or a good thing, but i am testing in ketosis and my dad told me I looked like I lost fifteen pounds so I assume I am in a good place.
I could eat some zero carb foods for the rest of the day if it meant was able to eat this:
https://cafedelites.com/chicken-tikka-masala/

I know cauliflower rice would work as a substitute for rice, but are there alternatives for the actual recipe? And is a tiny amount of brown sugar okay or does it kick you out of ketosis?

I was thinking maybe unsweetened almond milk or something instead of cream might help? It needs the tomato and it looks like coconut milk would have even more carbs. 

I don't know anything about the yogurt. I read on some site greek yogurt is more carb friendly? Has anyone tried low carb alternatives to yogurt for marinades?

And does anyone recommend a certain oil for this kind of stuff? It recommends vegetable oil, but I've been using olive oil or avocado oil since I started keto.

I know it sounds stupid, but this would literally be life changing for me because if I could find a version of this recipe that worked, i could probably keto for life.

I was totally in ketosis before consuming this meal, glucose ketone index of 2.1. .(79/1.9)

The next day, I repeat the meal but change the veggies to 4oz broccoli with some olive oil, higher fat content this time. Same result. 0.5 ketones.

Third day... Only had chicken, no veggies, paired it with mayo mixed with olive oil to drive up the fat. Same. Fucking. Thing. 

Day four- my strip with broccoli, all fine. Ratio similar to previous days. 

I also was stillout of ketosis in the mornings. Major headache as I wasn't kicked out due to carbs so I just had no brain energy source. Felt awful. 

I spoke to my doctor who is an expert in ketosis. She said for some reason (complicated explanation that I can't understand) , chicken is a major issue for some people, herself included. She has been strictly keto for years and finds the exact same thing.

So... As much as I love fried chicken, no more for me!",1

Hello.I'm 25m and I started the keto diet in july after I've been diagnosed prediabetic (119 FBS). I also tested HOMA-IR (0.8) HBA1C (5.3%) and Fasting Insulin (3.3) after that so everything other than FBS was quite good. I didn't do OGGT because I want to lose weight first and get to healthy BMI (I'm 190cm so still some weight to go).

My FBS is getting better (mostly under 100 nowadays, but it still can get up to 110-115 from time to time)

I'm a little concerned after today's bloodwork result because my cholesterol came flashing red:

But: How can be dropping 3+ pounds a week for weeks on end be healthy? 

I understand at first it's water weight, and then it's mostly just because of the change in diet, but I've seen posts that say ""40 pounds in 10 weeks!"", and it reminds me almost of those... weight loss scams. I KNOW. They aren't promoting anything, but still. Is there a scientific explanation? I always assumed that you should lose 1-2 pounds a week, max, once your water weight drops?

Also, I know that it is still healthier than the ""Plus Sized"" Movement/Philosophy, but when newbies like me who are (relatively) in the normal BMI range come and see ""96 pounds in 3 months!), it honestly seems a bit scary. 

Again, this is coming from someone who's only been on keto with his family for a few months, but could someone more knowledgeable explain why everyone keeps encouraging in this? Like if I went on r/fitness and said I lost 40 pounds in 2 months, I'd be referred to r/AskDocs.",1

According to [the diet doctor's advice](http://www.dietdoctor.com/lchf#advice), you can eat all the tomatoes you want (which is delightful to me!) This extends to other products as well, ex. avocado, aubergine, etc.

[Before/After](http://imgur.com/gallery/ZFirmXw)

(Sorry about the crap quality)

I figured that I have drawn off the energy of this group long enough that it was time for me to pay it forward and share some of my own success. I started keto back late March of this year. There are a long list of factors but the main ones being the realization that I had put myself in an at risk category for covid and my wife told me that she honestly didn't find me attractive from how big I was getting. Enough was enough, so I decided to commit to keto.

I started with dirty lazy keto which is arguably the simplest form. Really the only macro counting I did was keeping carbs below 20g per day. After about a month I was able to work in a 16:8 fasting schedule.

 Around 2 months in was when I truly became fat adapted and I experienced what is in my opinion the best part of this lifestyle. For my entire life I have struggled with food dependency, not just from the emotional aspect but Ive dealt with hypoglycemic episodes and energy troughs strong enough that I could just pass out. I had to eat almost constantly throughout the day just to function. Finally, once fat adapted i was able to think clearly and function throughout the day regardless of the last time that I had eaten. Over time through fasting I was also able to address and resolve alot of my own emotional connection with eating as well.

Since then I've been on a continuing journey to improve my diet to make it as sustainable in the long run as possible. I've adapted to a paleo/keto approach to consume as many whole foods as possible while maintaining a keto macro profile.

This journey has allowed me to conquer things in myself that I considered mainstays in my life. Depression and anxiety were things that on the best of days were kept at bay. These days I find myself free of those burdens almost entirely and that is an absolutely incredible feeling.

Thank you to this entire community, I have leaned on you all more then you could know. When I have days that I dont want to work out or feel a lack of motivation i come here to absorb the good vibes and positive energy. I see the success stories and they encourage me to push on with my own recovery and I am eternally grateful for that.

My encouragement to people new to keto, stick out the first couple months, its not always pleasant but once your body stabilizes its worth it (pink Himalayan salt, cream of tartar and chelated magnesium will work wonders to clear brain fog) to the experienced ketoers (ketoans?) I recommend working towards the cleanest diet possible. It makes a significant difference on mental clarity and how you feel physically and mentally day in and day out.

I’ve been eating plant based for almost 4 years. Love it! I used to have knee and hip joint pain for years and started having chest pains when I was 20. After changing to plant based it all went away quickly and I never had it again. 
A bit more then half a year ago I decided that I’m going to just go 100% and went vegan. Not a lot changed cus I didn’t eat much animal product after being plant based in the first place. 
I used to train twice a day, and just once on weekends (I am an MMA fighter. Some fitness in the morning, classes in the evening) and I felt fine and progressed with strength and fitness. 
For about the last 3-4 months I’ve been just feeling dead. Finishing a class or a training session is hard and I run out of gas, muscles feel weak and burned after the simplest things. I wake up sore every single day and it influences my life. Brain fog. It’s horrible. 
I tapered my training now to once a day and it still is the same, constantly tired, sore, and weak. A big thing I noticed too is I feel my heart beating now like it’s beating harder or louder, something that I never noticed before. I went to the doctor a couple of times already and done blood tests and I am perfect. Low Cholesterol, good iron levels, electrolytes, hormones and test. Everything looked perfect, the doctor had no answer. Last time though my blood pressure was considered high but there was no mention of it after. 
I usually eat as follows: 
Breakfast - oatmeal with soy milk, hemp,chia,flax,walnuts and berries
Lunch and dinner are flexible but usually involve some starch, legumes, random veggies and leafy greens. 
I supplement with b12 and have a multivitamin everyday. I use creatine and sometimes I use protein. 
I eat very similar to what plantbasedathlete on YouTube eats.

However, my family doesn't think the same and the dinners they make are full of oils, refined grains, sodium, sugar, and lacking in healthy whole plant foods and many nutrients (they're definitely not the worst though and always include veg).

I'm relatively new to the WFPB way of life: I started giving up meat and dairy around mid-May and have been trying to go more WFPB about 6 weeks ago. I've been experiencing a lot of frustration with it in the last couple weeks that has been really discouraging.

1. **I've hit a weight loss plateau.** I lost 20 lbs in 6ish weeks through just intermittent fasting before I gave up meat/dairy. I lost 10 lbs in the first 6 weeks of no animal products (eating salads and vegan junk food), but I've been totally stalled for 3 weeks... since I began trying to seriously decrease my salt/oil/sugar. I haven't given them up completely, but I'm eating SO MUCH LESS than I was before, so losing ZERO weight is driving me crazy. (And I'm 5'5"" 34F at 175 lbs, so it's not like I'm nearing my ideal weight or in peri-menopause or something.)
2. **The food takes FOREVER to prepare.** I'm a stay-at-home mom of three, so I do HAVE a lot more time to prepare food for myself during the day than those who work full time. I even like to cook! But between prepping food, cooking food, eating huge meals, making my kids separate food (because they won't eat anything I make for myself), and doing housework, Netflix has basically watched my kids ALL SUMMER. I'm super cranky all the time, because I'm either hungry (cuz bloody hell I just want to eat, how long is this food prep going to bloody take?), annoyed because I'm being interrupted 17000x cuz I'm busy ALL the time with food and my kids ""need"" stuff, or I'm feeling super guilty and selfish because I'm basically ignoring my kids for 3+ hours a day for ""me"" stuff. I'm only going to have one kid at home with me when school starts in a couple weeks. She's not going to have a big sister to play with her or distract her when I need AN HOUR to cut veggies for a stir fry, or put together a GIGANTIC SALAD. Or the 30 minutes it takes me to EAT the huge portions of food. I really haven't gotten batch cooking down (cuz geez, if it takes an hour to prep ONE meal, I'd literally have to have someone take my kids for a day to prep for a week! And that's just for me! Imagine if my family ate this way too!). I could really use some ideas for FAST meals. I have an Instant Pot....
3. **The food is getting REALLY boring.** Like, seriously boring. I love veggies. I really do. But having a salad every day with bland dressing or a stir-fry every night with the same couple sauces... UGH! I've been trying to incorporate more potatoes, but without vegan butter and salt, it's not even worth putting in my mouth. Today, I didn't even want to eat. I was hungry, but the idea of prepping food for an hour made me want to curl up in bed and cry. I was like, ""Maybe I'll just fast for a week so I can have a break from effing food."" I ate a large fry from McDonald's, a banana, and a mango for dinner, because I just couldn't bring myself to do anything more. 

Anyway, I could probably say more, but that was all so negative, I can't even anymore. I'm tired. If you have any advice, ideas, or whatever, I sure could use them. I'm about ready to jump off this boat.",0

I've been doing keto about a month now. I should be down about 10 pounds, but I'm actually up about 15 pounds. I can't tell you how fucking damaged I was after that. 

I've been tracking my carbs, and there were only 2 days when I went above 20g. One day was my wife's birthday 2 weeks ago, and then one random day when I realized too late that the peanut butter I was snacking on was reduced fat, and had too many carbs per serving (14g / 2tbs) and went to like.. 35 - 40g on the day.

They only other thing I can imagine is that it's I'm eating way too many calories. I switched my desk to a standing position to try and burn more calories throughout the day. The three calories burned calculators I've used say that I'm burning an average of 500 more cal / day- but that seems a little high for just 9 hours of standing and moving around. I try to workout as much as I can, but I wake up at 0430 to begin with for work, and by the time I get home at 16:00, I'm fucking exhausted.

I also try to stick to 20/4 intermittent fasting. The only thing I can imagine is that I'm fucking starving when I get home, and just go hammer on all the fucking food, and eat like, 3000 calories. That's got to be it, right?

I'm telling you, getting on the scale and seeing such a huge jump really put me into a depressed tailspin. I stuck with the diet, but I was depressed as fuck for the entire week.",1

I get about 3 or 4 different brands that are good although I have got some recently that was like the grainy mush from the '90s.

I've recently heard a few opinions that WW pasta is crap. This surprises me. I'm wondering how widespread it is.

Either WW pasta changed or I have changed and it really is crap that I've become accustomed to. I'm curious which.

I've lost 120 lbs and found a new sense of love and acceptance for myself that I have never had before. [Here is the before and after photo](https://i.redd.it/mz0cvyoawhr51.png)


Coming off the holidays, I was in a deeply depressive state. My divorce was dragging and the memories of my ex were raging in my mind. To assuage the pain alcohol flowed and with it, came binge eating and lack of action to fully accept everything. 

Now, I had been attending therapy for over a year at that point and some of the actions were working to get over the abuse from her and my childhood but it was going... slowly...As the days rolled on, a few  things led to a major change in mindset. 

1. Reading: Man's search for meaning by Victor Frankl - This book really brought forward all of the words and actions the therapists were teaching me and the idea of ""Mindfulness"" finally clicked in my mind. Being mindful of my feelings allowed allowed me to gain a deeper acceptance of myself and really start to find self love. 
1. Being challenged to a run by a friend: A friend of mine challenged me to a 10 mile in January and it absolutely crushed my body. At mile 8 my body just quit on me and being 345 lbs, I was not in a good way. I ended up laying on a picnic bench and staring at the sky contemplating my feelings and life. I started using some of the therapy techniques to tell myself it was ok and that I still love me even if I ""failed"" at this. I also told myself I could do better and will be better. 
1. Finally not feeling a deep sense of shame when looking at myself in the mirror: For the vast, vast majority of my life, I could never look at myself in the mirror. The moment I saw my reflection, I felt a profound sense of shame and disgust with who I was and what I looked like. Well, one cold day in late January, I was found myself venturing towards a dissociative freeze state. I started talking internally to myself saying things like ""dont go there"" or ""your ok"", and ""I love you Jeff"". Well, as I managed to crawl out of bed, I went to the bathroom mirror and started repeating these things to myself out loud and with a little more confidence. After doing that, I took some silly selfies and really reflected on the idea of ""self love"" and ""self acceptance"", and something changed in me... I looked at myself at 345 lbs and I said ""I love you, no matter what"". And at that moment... I knew I needed to do better by me. 

So starting in early February, I became accountable to myself and told myself I am going to do better and be healthier for me. I had been lurking here for awhile and seeing all of the success stories told me that I needed to try this. I was never really big into carbs unless I was drinking and generally love all of the ""keto safe"" foods. So fudge it, lets give it a whirl!

For the first few months, it was straight Keto/16:8 IF. No bread. No pasta. Low carb life ladies and gents. ""Sorry, I cant have pizza with you today"" or ""Can I swap the mashed potatoes for a salad"" became common utterances before COVID. I also told friends and family that I am not going to drink with them like I used to. I was no longer a regular at any of the bars. Some of the regulars would text me, asking me if I am coming down for a pint and I said no. I lost all of those ""friends"". 

As things started to progress, I had lost 30 lbs just before the start of COVID and colleagues were congratulating me and said they could see the difference. This was a nice boost but it was not what was driving me. I needed to do this for me so I could live the life I want. I kept struggling and grinding with everything, pushing to go farther and father with running and having a healthy grip on my food intake. 

Things kept evolving and the weight kept coming off. By May I had lost 60 pounds and was running 20 miles a week. I was really looking up to see where this would take me and how far I could go. But disaster struck, I hurt myself on my first 10 mile run and now, running was out of the question. ""Oh what am I todo?!"" I found myself feeling the twinges of giving up. Instead, I decided to research proper stretches, recovery techniques, and other factors to stay on track and get ready for my first half marathon. I consulted with friends who have been running for a long time and they signed off on my plans and that help was enough to keep out of the mental storm and keep focused on staying in ketosis while working for the longer run. 

After recovering all May and June, the final dreaded day approached. 1st half marathon time! I was down 80 pounds at this point and just ready to go! **This half marathon was abysmal!!** My brain and body while going through those miles were hating me every stride of the way. However, once done I thought to myself ""ya know, that was half bad!"" and decided I wanted to keep going further. At this point I was now running 25-30 miles a week, doing some body weight exercise and still keeping away from binging or drinking. 

As the training ramped up, I started to feel really sluggish on my longer runs... I didn't have enough energy and or it was too hot out to run effectively, so midsummer I started getting up before sunrise to run. Running in the middle/end of your fast feels...very interesting. My body really started to take advantage of the ketosis and more weight was falling off. But... at this point I needed to start including some carbs to prevent what happened in May so I adopted a Cyclical Keto diet where I would carb load the days before my long runs! Can you say delicious vegetarian food and rice or sushi! 

That carb boost allowed me to push harder and harder. More weight kept coming off and by the end of August I had lost 100 lbs! At that point, I was below 250 for the first time since I tried to join the Army and I am ecstatic!!! My body feels great, I don't feel forced from something outside to want to lose the weight, and I don't feel shame looking in the mirror. Self love abounds!

As the end of summer continues, my divorce continues to drag on and COVID keeps the world shut down, I just keep running, working and staying true to my diet and myself. The progress is slowing. The weight changes aren't as drastic but the loss is still consistent. 

September starts to come to a close and I have success after success with running. 18 miles down to center city. 20 miles in the mountains and more weight comes off. Then my divorce finally comes through and I take some time to celebrate and wish the ex well by pouring out a little scotch for her and our marriage. Family and friends see my changes and they want to see me in socially distant settings. All of this has me feeling like the ""Bell of the Ball"" and an exhausted introvert. In my quiet reflective moments, I keep working on my runs and staying true to my Keto/16:8 IF even when being hosted by friends/family. 

Then this past weekend, I run my first marathon! 26.2 miles in 6hrs and 30 mins. Fuuudge... By this point I have lost 120 lbs and am only 15 pounds away from my goal weight...

I have some empty capsules lying around, I can fill them easily but I wonder whether consuming solid salt is a good idea.

He was just spouting the same old tired archaic nonsense about counting calories and he said point blank ""All the girls in the room, you're *allowed* 1800 calories."" I just wanted to slap him!! It depends on what types of calories they're eating, their daily activity, their weight and height and plenty of other factors to know how many ""calories"" they should be consuming. He offered snacks to the kids and then ""punished""(not really but gave more negative consequences) to the kids who took soda and pizza more so than the kids who took oranges.  But depending on how sensitive those kids are to insulin swings the orange may as well be just as bad for them than the soda!! Sure it's got vitamins and a bit of fiber but in reality if these kids(teenagers really) are struggling with their weight the last thing they need is a sugary snack that's going to have them starving in an hour! And I remember how excited Jamie got that the cooks were serving students white rolls that were made in the kitchen. Complete white flour doughy carb loaded cheap rolls. THEY MAY AS WELL FEED THE KIDS CAKE!!! But they were made there in the kitchen so Jamie loved it! His heart may be in the right place(really I'm not sure how much he cares about kid's nutrition in American schools, I think he's probably just in it for the tv contract money) but it'd be nice if we could just look at the science and move on from being a calorie counting obsessive low fat nation and become a healthy society that follows the dietary guidelines that we evolved on. 

EDIT: Damn y'all all made me feel like an asshole, but that's ok sometimes I am an asshole. I wanna make that Okay face from the rage comics. To be honest I just got emotional about it, when I was younger I struggled a lot like those kids and the only thing that fixed it was keto NOT everything Jamie says to do(which might work for those kids what do I know) so I got all attached to the little chunk nuggets because they reminded me of my young self and got fired up from that.

However, this WOE threw a bit of a wrench into our weekly date night. For the past two years, we’ve gone to our favorite Thai restaurant once a week to get mostly fried rice or pad woon sen (neither of which are options now). In this time we’ve become friends with the owner of the restaurant and they always know to expect us on Wednesday nights. 

Last week we had some pretty heavy snow so we weren’t able to make it out to the restaurant during the very start of the diet, but I’ve been really worried about going out to Thai now that we’re eating Keto - I didn’t want to lose this weekly tradition of spending time together and seeing the restaurant staff that have become our friends and I didn’t want them to lose our business either! 

In preparation, we fasted today (which was so much easier than I thought it would be!!), then this evening we went to the restaurant and talked to the owner about what Keto was and why we’re doing it (weight loss/health/PCOS). He said “We’ll take care of you” and brought us giant plates of roasted chicken, stir fried pork belly, and green veggies. It was absolutely wonderful!!! He told us “2018 will be your year”. 

At the end of the meal, they always bring you fortune cookies with the check. After they set down the bill/cookies, we heard him say “oh shit! Sorry!” and he came back to take the cookies away. 

I was really grateful that they went out of their way to make off-menu items for us and that they were so supportive. Having people around you that lift you up really makes a world of difference.",1

First: I love Keto! It is the first diet (and I tried a lot) where I am not hungry at all. 

I am tracking everything and I am very strict. I am female, 1,60m small and my weight is 80,4kg. My calories are 1500 kcal a day. Under 20g Carbs, 60g Protein and 120g Fat, sometimes the Protein is a little bit higher around 70-80g but I try to hit the 60.

I do workouts 2-3 a week and my biggest handicap is my hypotheroidism, I need 100 µm a day. I visited the doctor 2 weeks ago and my blood values are superb, especially my triglycerids and my other cholesterols.

Have you any tipps for me to break that damn wall?

I have been doing Keto for about a month and half now and have lost 30 pounds! It’s amazing. I’m hoping for an update on loss because I weigh in every Sunday (tomorrow). I’ve been extremely strict and have been trying my best to stay at absolutely zero carbs.. it is difficult but has payed off.

Please share any zero carb snacks that you have.. The more the better. Variety (and being good at the same time) on zero carbs isn’t always easy. (And besides pickles!!)

I threw out a half-eaten packet of blackcurrant pastilles that was in my desk drawer at work, I've avoided the demon temptress of the crisps/chips charity boxes in the lunchroom and I've eschewed rice in favour of a lovely cauliflower ""fried rice"" last night.

But today was sprung on me by mum that she expected me for dinner, and it would be tacos. Now, for a host of very complicated and probably therapy-worthy reasons, I don't discuss my efforts at life-changing actions with my mother. Mostly because she is horrifically nosy, and loves to tell me what I should be doing. And how I'm doing it wrong. And why it didn't work when she did it. And why I should lose weight. And so on. Being so new to keto I didn't really want to say ""Sorry, no carbs"" because then I'd have to explain, then would be the lecture and so on.

So instead I graciously accepted, but instead of the three or four tacos I'd normally pack away on taco night I decided to try and minimise the damage. One taco shell, broken into shards. Pile on the meat, the cheese, avocado and sour cream. Little bit of lettuce. Kind of a taco salad, but let her think I was doing the nacho thing.

It seemed to work, she didn't comment on it and my charade seemed to pass unnoticed. But now I'm second-guessing myself and wondering if I've undone all the work I've done over the course of the last three days. 

I guess what I'm doing is partially confessing and partially wondering, if you're in a situation where something carb-y is on the table and saying ""No, I'm not eating carbs"" would be terribly rude, is it better to just have a small amount and try to minimise the impact, or better still to fall to the floor and fake your own death?",1

"Dieting for Disney, Completed",1872,9ay6q3,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9ay6q3/dieting_for_disney_completed/,173,1535485488.0,"Hi all, thought I'd take the chance to tell my story. I've read along for the last 8 months and it always seemed that someone would post an update whenever I needed to see someone else succeed to motivate me, so this is my turn to pay it forward.

M/38/6ft

I had my annual checkup in December, and I was surprised by how much I'd let myself go. I weighed in at 318, my highest weight ever, and worse, I was beginning to show signs of high blood pressure for the first time in my life. I decided I needed to try to lose weight before it did permanent damage.

In addition, we have been saving for a few years to take a family vacation to Disney World. From our last trip in 2013, I knew how uncomfortable walking around the parks carrying 50 extra pounds could be. I couldn't imagine carrying that 50, and another 50 on top, around the parks in the Florida heat. Not to mention the struggle trying to fit in some of the safety harnesses. I felt that I owed it to my daughters (9-year-old twins, and a 4-year-old, all named after princesses) to get in better shape for the trip. That gave me 8 months. I wanted to lose at least 60 lbs, so I'd be the same size I was when we last went to Disney World 5 years ago. ""Dieting for Disney"" became my mantra, and one my kiddos easily latched onto, providing me with positive reinforcement. ""Daddy's dieting for our trip to Disney World!""

I started on January 3rd with little-to-no direction. I'd done Adkins in the past and lost as much as 50lbs, so I started there again. But, I quickly remembered why I couldn't make the diet work long term. I've always been a picky eater, and 7 days a week of baked chicken and green beans grew tiresome quickly. Three weeks in, and I was already trying to find reasons to have a ""cheat meal"" whenever possible.

When I get bored in the wee hours of the night, I browse r/all. I don't remember the post, but I saw someone's victory thread on r/loseit, where they mentioned that they lost their weight via keto. I read up on the diet, found the keto board, and gave it a try. I've never been big on counting anything when I eat (hence the reason I broke 300lbs), but this time everything seemed to click. I found the keto recipes board and decided, if I was already miserable with what I was eating, I might as well try new things. I don't know if it was the diet that changed my taste buds, if it was getting older, or if I finally reached a point in my life where I was ready for tastes other than meat, cheese, potatoes, and bread. I experimented with new foods... and it worked. I learned to make a basic cream sauce, and that, more than anything, drove my first month of success.  I tried broccoli (covered in cream sauce) and fried mushrooms (covered in cream sauce), until I eventually learned to like both on their own. I learned to slice up and sauté red peppers. I caramelized onions. I eat celery stalks like they're candy canes. I stopped looking at this as a diet and began to see it as an excuse to try new things.

Four months into this, I read up on intermittent fasting. Since keto meant I was never hungry anyway, I gave it a try. I went 16/8. It was a breeze. A week later I went 20/4. It was so easy I finally went OMAD, and I've been there for two-three months now. It really turbo charged the weight loss and I plowed through the last 40lbs with ease.

Which brings me to today. We go to Disney World soon, so this past weekend was my final weigh-in before the trip.

https://imgur.com/a/3tkzY1v

January 3rd: 318lbs. August 25th: 204lbs. 114 pounds lost in under 8 months.

I've started to add carbs in this week in preparation for the trip, I want to enjoy the Food and Wine festival, but I plan to return to low carb eating habits when we get back.

Things that worked:
Having a super supportive wife and kids to motivate me.

Having a goal other than a number on the scale. Whenever I felt tempted to quit I thought about how much fun I wanted my girls to have in Disney World. I didn't want to slow them down because daddy needed to stop and sit a spell every 50 steps. 

Diet soda. If I ever got hungry, this helped. I couldn't get into Lacroix, but y'all do y'all.

Fun cardio. Instead of running around a track I play basketball or swim.

r/ketorecipes. There are so many good things you can eat on this diet. Be adventurous with your food.

Discovering Penzey's spices. I bought some Foxpoint seasoning for the Christmas sale and love it so much I went back for more... and more. My father-in-law had to build me a new spice rack to handle all the spices I've since bought.

Cheese. I'm convinced that loving cheese in all its forms is the secret to keto.

TLDR: Was fat. Tried keto. Now not fat.

P.S. If any of you work for/with the Mouse and want to spread some pixie dust, I'd totally let you use this for any purposes, nefarious or otherwise, in exchange for Mickey's Not-So-Scary-Halloween tickets.

The about-face includes:

* Admitting that dietary fat is nothing to worry about.
* Acknowledging that salt intake is not usually a problem and doesn't need restricting.
* Realizing that **added sugars** are really, really bad.

They just need to take a teeny tiny peek in their biochemistry textbooks to realize that is is not just crystalline sugars which are bad, but also [starch forms of sugars are, actually, effectively the same!](http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/basics/polysac.html)

What I want is mandatory re-training of all licensed / registered dietitians and nutritionists who are members of the academy. Such a huge, 180 degree change in dietary advice is staggering, and unprecedented. This shouldn't just be swept under the rug.

Anyways, the order comes out and it was full of potatoes, so I asked for it to be made without potatoes.
I get back my order and the bowl is ridiculously tiny without the bacon and guac. And I had paid $4.68 for this sad small bowl of pico de gallo and some bacon bits.
At that point I got frustrated that they had managed to mess up the order twice when I tried to stress the no potatoes, etc.

Discourse?,6,9f18qf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/9f18qf/discourse/,21,1536727719.0,"TLDR: is natural fat in vegetables and nuts the problem, or is the highly processed, high sodium foods most Americans eat the real culprit?

The past couple months I’ve adopted a vegetarian diet that is low in dairy and eggs, but I’m gravitating towards WFPB. My last two years of college were heavy in fast food and prepackaged high sodium food, which is counter to the way I ate growing up. 

My question is this: a lot of the folks I’ve been watching, Esselstyn, Greger, etc advocate for the strictest diet even eliminating avocados and nuts. In my research of everything from the Mediterranean diet(which is closest to what I eat.) to WFPB, it seems the common variable is how processed, salty and full of fat everything in America is.

If you’re eating a diet high in fiber, for example the other night I roasted eggplant in chopped tomatoes with mushrooms and garlic and I had some multigrain bread with it. But if I use olive oil to cook that, that is certainly better than my neighbor who is chowing down on hot pockets and potato chips.

But is that so bad that I might as well be eating a value meal ? It seems like in the opinion of the WFPB practitioners that is the case, but I have trouble buying it seeing as how some of the oldest living cultures still eat cheese and oil.

I’d love to hear your thoughts. Thanks.

I started this year as a 6'3"" man weighing *278.8 pounds*. And as of this morning, I'm still a man, still the same height, but now I weigh *206 pounds*. That's pretty neat.

And you know what? I'm giving up my fear of posting myself on Reddit. Some of you post in your underwear and that's tremendous. Here's a before and after: https://imgur.com/a/SHnrDnD 

This sub has been a huge inspiration for me (and although I don't comment a lot, I'd say it's instrumental in my success). Here are some things I learned, things that happened, and things I wish would happen.

* **Your weight loss will get noticed around 2-3 months** – This was the point where people were actually impressed that I lost weight while putting butter in my coffee (and on my burgers and basically anywhere else butter would go). 
* **Take embarrassing before pics** – I did not and I regret it a ton. Now I can't get a super upvoted post! 
* **Learn how to hide those pics on your phone** – If you're on an iPhone, go to your camera roll. Hit ""select"" in the upper right hand corner. Select relevant pictures and tap the icon in the bottom left. Select ""Hide"" and they'll all go into a hidden album that won't show up when you hand your phone to your family.
* **The George Foreman grill is my savior** – Honestly, I don't know why getting a G.F. grill isn't recommended more on this sub. You eat so much meat. You will have fast access to meat even on nights you don't wanna eat meat. 
* **I actually kinda like clothes now** – I always said that I bought clothes thinking about comfort over style. And I'd wear the same clothes for years (maybe decades?). But now, I care about what I wear.
* **Check yourself out more** – Lost 100 pounds? 50? 5? Doesn't matter. Take a gander at yourself and smile. You did it. Even if it's hard to notice, just give yourself a smile to keep on going. 
* **Don't buy a ton of new clothes at once, though** – I went from 40"" waist to a 38"" waist and I got a ton of new nice pants. Now I'm a 36"" and Goodwill has a ton of new nice pants. 
* **Being ""large"" is part of our identity. Identities are hard to change.** – I always thought I was an XL human. Lots of my jokes are about gluttony. And now that I'm an L human, I have to rethink who I am (weird). But it's possible! 
* **Going out to eat still kinda sucks** – Let's not pretend that it doesn't. Yeah, you can usually get a bunless burger at most places. But if you're going to some chichi eatery and not some chain restaurant, it'll be rough.  
* **I cheat on vacation** – If you learn the heuristic, ""when I'm away from home, I eat whatever I want,"" it's fine. Just make sure you don't bring back any tempting sweets with you and go back to your nice, keto-friendly kitchen.
* **Feeling your ribcage is so god damn weird** – I still haven't gotten over the fact that I can feel the little ridges. Individual ribs! My chest is a rack of ribs! My shoulder is so pointy. What is this? 
* **It's not losing weight, it's growing your dick** – Sorry for the gross one. But if you're ever like, ""Should I give up keto?"" Rephrase it as, ""Do I want my dick to shrink?"" 
* **Evangelizing about keto is like being a Jehovah's Witness** – And no offense to any Witnesses here, but no one wants to be preached at. If people ask, I tell them that I did keto, a brief explanation of what it is, and then I ask: Hey, if you're interested in more, I'm happy to talk with you about it. 
* **Read this sub** – The reason Weight Watchers does so well is because they've created an amazing community (in person and on WW Connect). It helps so much to hear what other people are going through. Leave a nice comment on a low-effort, well-meaning post. It's nice. 
* **Be nice on this sub** – Yeah, some people don't read the FAQ and can't Google, but everyone here is tryin' to make their lives better. The world is negative enough these days, let's be a cool force for kindness and health. 
* **I wish I could be part of xxketo** – Literally the nicest sub in the world. So much insight, perspective, and heart that you'd never experience as a man. Can I please be a part? 
* **When in doubt, electrolytes** – If you can't put your finger on something and you're just kind of feeling weird, just pound some and it might work.
* **All my cool band shirts don't fit** – I've been buying XL shirts since ... maybe I was 12? And all the cool shirts I've collected over the year no longer fit. This sucks.
* **Save that bacon fat, it's not (that) weird** – I've got a mason jar that has pig fat in it, you guys. When you're done cooking bacon, wrap a coffee filter around a jar, and pour the grease into it. Then use it instead of butter when cooking something kinda boring and make it extra awesome. 
* **Keto won't fix your life** – Some people do keto and suddenly have no more illness, they're running 4 minute miles, Swedish models start following them around, and crisp $20 bill shows up in their front pocket every morning. Not me. Yes, keto gave me more energy and I feel a lot better, but it's not a magic bullet. 
* **People are nicer to thinner people** – It's not right. But it's true. So when you start lookin' your max beautiful, just remember to be nice to larger people. 
* **I sweat a lot less** – Any folks here hate summer 'cause it turns you into an unpresentable mess the second you step outside? Well, if you keto hard enough for long enough, you'll learn to hate summer a lot less.
* **I've never made fathead dough** – It just seems like slightly more work than I want to do. Is it worth it, you guys?
* **People want to weigh less, they don't want to lose weight** – People will ask you about your success and will immediately list off the carbs they could never give up. It's fine. You can't save everyone. 
* **KCKO is a stupid phrase, but smart advice** – Might as well say ""got keto?"" But if you slip up, don't sweat it. Just go eat and egg and you'll be fine. 
* **Find a keto sweet-o that you're into** – Personally, I mess around with ChocZero products, Fat Snax cookies, and Lily's chocolates. If they don't stall you and they fit your macros, go for it. Sweets are nice.
* **There is no True Keto** – Are you losing weight, feeling better, and keeping your carbs low? Then you're doin' keto your way. And that is awesome.

I went plant based about 7 months ago and shortly after fully plant based vegan after educating myself about that. 

I want to know how to explain this to my partner and help them understand my decision. Admittedly my inital attempts were feeble,  I just said ""because it's healthier"" this was met with a not very nice attitude and so I retreated and didn't explain any further. Now I would like to sit down and explain my reasoning maybe show a documentary or video of a plant based dr. 

My partner considers themself pretty healthy, they eat a lot of meat, eggs and cheese but a lot of plants as well. They also do a lot of exercise and look very fit. 

Since going plant based vegan I have had remarks such as being too difficult and other snide remarks. I want to sit down and have a good conversation I think that emphasising health and environment would be the best route for this person. 

Any advice? Anybody been through a similar scenario? Any help is appriciated. Thank you 😁",0

It took a couple months to get my head back in the game and restart the keto lifestyle that I really do love. Now I’m back, full-time and faithful.

A few months later I started cutting back on bread, pasta, candy and pastries (After listening to Joe Rogan and Gary Taubes). A year ago my A1C was 8.8. I did start feeling better, but it took me a few more months to really get serious. In July I started keeping track of my macros and exercising (something I never did) and when I got into ketosis I immediately started feeling great and losing weight. In August, my A1C was 6.5 and my doctor was really impressed. He cut my meds back and told me to keep it up. Now I am down 50 lbs. I went to the doctors this morning and he told me that my A1C is 5.4 and that I could stop all of my diabetes medication. I also stopped my blood pressure and cholesterol meds and he told me that that was fine too. 

I work construction and always struggled because it is physically demanding. Now, work doesn't suck as bad as it used to mostly because of the crashes after eating a carb heavy break and lunch. I always felt I needed a nap in the afternoon. So, keto made me not hate my job so much. I don't have before and after pics, but I'll see if I can dig up something that's not too long before I started keto. 
   
Thanks to everyone that posts on here, you have all been very helpful.

I think that I should also add that I am 48 yrs old and I was diagnosed with Type 2 in 2006 I think.",1
Doctor told me I had “fantastic” vitals today...then I told him what I eat,2546,7pgryi,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7pgryi/doctor_told_me_i_had_fantastic_vitals_todaythen_i/,616,1515631243.0,"I know others have made similar posts. My doctor was very impressed with my vitals today, particularly my blood pressure. Then he asked me what I ate daily and I told him a 1/2 pound of bacon or smoked salmon and cream cheese for breakfast, 8 oz of 80/20 beef for lunch (either as a burger or taco meat) and usually seafood, pork or steak for dinner. I added that I usually have spinach with lunch and eat green beans, brussel sprouts or broccoli with dinner.

He said he was honestly “shocked” and then started preaching about how I needed to eat whole grains and cut my animal fat consumption.

I’m going to go with my vitals being great and keep doing keto.",1

Felt better immediately afterwards and went back to sleep.  Today, right before lunch, I vomited again.  Was feeling a little shaky beforehand and felt much better afterwards.  I am hitting the 1000mg potassium most days (and sometimes hit 1500mg-ish) but I am short on the sodium, by 1-2000mg.  Do you think the vomiting is from lack of sodium?

Cutting out caffeine won't suck so bad now that I have a CPAP for my severe sleep apnea (12 months and going). It turns out that caffeine makes you lose zinc, magnesium, and calcium all needed for sleep. All this with the cortisol that comes from caffeine is great for making you fat around the gut. By the way you have 4 times the cortisol receptors around your belly to keep you protected from getting slashed in the gut by predators.

The vitamin C has really made me feel more relaxed. I was taking an adrenal supplement only, but this has been helping more it seems. It  definitely feels good. Also vitamin C helps your metabolism because your body uses it for the Kreb Cycle (it produces its own, but this couldn't hurt). 

I will let you guys know in a month how much I have succeeded.

BTW now that I am watching my caffeine intake my insulin and blood sugar is more stabilized so I feel it will really help with my success on keto. Maybe this is something you would want to try.

Don't compare yourself to people losing large amounts in short time frames [Pep-Talk],1794,8palbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/8palbz/dont_compare_yourself_to_people_losing_large/,248,1528409324.0,"Hi All,

I just wanted to give a little shout out to people who lose far slower than what appears to be the norm on this sub.

Most of the front page posts are how someone lost 45 pounds in under two months (or something like that), and that can make you feel like you're doing something wrong.

Losing 1-2 pounds a week is a very normal weight loss speed. Some weeks, you might not lose at all. Every body is different. As long as you're maintaining your macros, the trend will continue downwards, which is what you want!

Obviously, everyone wants the quick fix, but that's not reality for the majority of people.

Remember, that the more you weigh, the more you have to lose, so heavier people tend to lose at an increased rate. Once you get smaller, your weight loss may slow down significantly. You're not doing anything wrong, it's perfectly normal. 

Besides, it's rare someone will post that they lost 2 pounds this week, so all you're left seeing is the extreme cases, but that doesn't mean the majority aren't just like you!

So don't look at the front page posts and think that what you've achieved isn't as good. You've already taken a huge step in taking control of your weight and what you eat. That alone is commendable.

Rejoice other's success but also celebrate your own, no matter how small!

You may use Ketostix at the very beginning of your ketogenic diet to see if there are any ketones you are excreting. Now you know, that you are tending to the right direction.

In the further progress, Ketostix are not needed anymore and would be a waste of money.

We have three types of ketones: 
Aceton, Acetoacetat, Beta-Hydroxybutyrat .

The longer you are in ketosis, the more you will produce Beta-Hydroxybutyrat which can not be measured by Ketostix. But this is exactly that type of keton, we want to produce.

So even if your Stix go from Pink to white again, this is no indicator for your ketosis to decrease. It could even be an indicator for your ketosis to go to the exactly right point.",1

It's funny three months if plateau. Then, it's like a bathroom emergency....the way I just broke through my stall! ( dad jokes for days!!). But seriously, it's all about that consistency. No battle is hard, it's the way that is difficult. Therefore, win battles and forget about the war. If you lose one battle, its just one, it wont cost you the war. 

The first thing that was a battle was just deciding to start. 

The second battle was making it one day 

The third battle was remembering to keep fighting battle 2 

The other key to my success was simply learning to create delicious keto foods. I make keto rangoons, pizzas, cheeseburgers, etc. In addition to the normal steak and bacon deliciousness.

Happy Friday's eve all!

Down 200 lbs in 1 year naturally with diet and exercise. From 438 lbs to 238 lbs!,3222,cmrd4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/cmrd4e/down_200_lbs_in_1_year_naturally_with_diet_and/,306,1565130930.0,"[Before And After Picture (438 lbs to 238 lbs)](https://imgur.com/gallery/j75bxFC)

This week I have weighed in at 238 LBS, which officially puts me at a total loss of exactly 200 pounds! A lot of hard work and dedication has led me to where I am today, and although I’m still not finished my journey (~ 20-30ish pounds to lose) I am truly grateful and proud of what I have been able to accomplish up to this point, and for how much my life has improved as this journey has gone on. 

After doing Keto and any other diet technique, one thing I have continued to stick with, as mentioned in my [initial update](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/bxievh/weight_loss_update_438_lbs_to_260_lbs_180_pounds/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app); is IF/OMAD (Intermittent Fasting/One Meal A Day) while keeping CICO in mind (Calories In Calories Out). In terms of exercise, I was doing a 5 day ULPPL (Upper Lower Push Pull Legs) Bodybuilding Routine alongside post-lifting cardio, usually HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training), on at least 3 of those days. Also, I try to remain active and ideally get some form of cardio in through sports or whatever else I can on my rest days. And this is all done in a fasted state to help burn calories/fat more efficiently and boost metabolism etc. 

I have faced plenty of adversity during this journey, though have nonetheless stayed relentless in achieving my goals. The love and support I have received from this community in my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/bxievh/weight_loss_update_438_lbs_to_260_lbs_180_pounds/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app) has definitely helped push me to work that much harder and something I will never take for granted. 

I really want to set an example for how much power we all have within us, whether it’s related to weight loss or not; we all have the potential to accomplish such great things that often isn’t realized. Whatever it is you desire to accomplish, whether it’s losing/gaining weight or whatever else, please remember how much YOU yourself are capable of, and to never sell yourself short. Realize your potential and realize it is never too late to make a change or better yourself. 

I‘ve constantly been trying to lose weight practically my whole life, since I was just a child, and the best decision I made was to never give up. Now here I am today, not at the end of my journey, but several steps ahead of where I was when I started and constantly pushing forward. Will be updating you guys again once I reach my final goal weight (~ 20-30ish lbs away), until then wishing the best to each and every one of you in your journeys, stay blessed! 🙏❤️",1

Not sure when it happened, but I don't even feel like I look like me anymore. I'm my lowest weight in over 20 years
 I havent been this small ever. I havent weighed this little since middle school. I still have another 40 to 50 pounds to drop, and I will. I'm going to Chicago this weekend to celebrate. 2 nights living it up sounds amazing right now. I'm excited to enjoy my time in chi-town.

It's nice to be able to walk around without feeling like I need to take a rest every 4 steps. I feel like I don't draw attention by walking into a room, and that anonymity wraps around me like the world's most magnificent security blanket.

I can't believe my hair brain keto way of life has produced such amazing ( sugar free) fruits of my labor.

I'm extremely grateful for this community and each of you that have helped me on this Journey. THANK YOU ALL. I hope you all have a great weekend full of steak and eggs and personal victories. 

As always, remember: weigh food not people.",1

For reference, I’ve been on keto since September 14, 2018.  I started with strict keto and no exercise because I was injured. I then added intermittent fasting, and I follow a 16:8 schedule daily with 2 24-hour fasts on the weekends. Now that I’ve recovered from my injury, I’m a group fitness instructor at LA Fitness and teach Zumba classes 3 nights a week. I’m also a competitive powerlifter and train with weights 3 nights a week 😊

If you’re reading this and thinking about starting keto and aren’t sure how, just jump in!! Make a goal to be a little bit better each day or week. Don’t expect perfection out of yourself in the beginning, and know that each setback is a chance to come back even better the next week 👍🏻 thanks for the inspiration and recipes, y’all!

Long time lurker, first time poster. Started Keto 2/11/19 SW 222 CW 179 GW 150.  Excuse the shitty pics- I hate photos of myself and didn’t think to take a before pic so the left is me in January singing my heart out to some Billy Joel at my cousins wedding. When I saw that pic I was mortified! It’s the biggest I’ve ever been! I had done IF in the past and successfully lost 60lbs over a year- but I never conquered my sweet tooth or dependency on carbs and sugar. I would break fast with a box of Good & Plenty and drink all the delicious craft beers and eat all the pasta and all the bread. Eventually, once life got in the way and I stopped IF it caught up to me and all came back. This time around I’m determined to break my addiction to sugar. I can’t believe how quickly it has come off- I know I won’t keep dropping like this and the last 30 lbs will be the hardest but I’M HERE FOR IT!  This sub has kept me super motivated- especially when I’m feeling particularly weak. I love seeing all the progress pics so I’m sharing mine in thanks to all of you!",1

Cant express how happy I am with the progress I’ve made. In less than 3 months I was already half way to my goal. Before keto I was at my worst. Heaviest I had ever been feeling the lost confident ever. I was self conscious, depressed, and overall just not taking care of myself. 

Keto has definitely brought on some mental fog, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. But overall, I have more energy, feel more confident, and am extremely proud of my commitment and the progress I’ve made. I haven’t weighed this little in over 3 years!!!

Thanks to everyone on this sub for all the support through my journey. You guys have all been a great driving force in my commitment to the diet and so many of you are so inspiring! (:

I saw 300 on the dot last weekend, and I figured it was time for some progress photos.  The before photo is still a few pounds shy of my highest weight, I might be 350 there and I got up to 365 (one pound for ever day of the year!) at my highest.  These pics are almost exactly a year apart, but I got started in earnest last October.  It hasn't been a smooth downward trend, I've had lots of setbacks, but I've been killing it since February of this year.  I'm aiming to see 250 by New Year's.

I try for 1200-1400 calories a day, IF and even OMAD if I can manage it.  That kind of thing would never be possible on a regular diet for me, I'd be going crazy with hunger.  I eat quite a few keto-replacement foods like fake bread, which makes things a lot easier and as long as I'm still losing weight, I'll continue to do so.  I also drink Coke Zero, no more than one per day, and make sweet tea with erythritol and monk fruit.  I also just discovered Virgil's black cherry sugar-free soda and I wish it wasn't so expensive!

For exercise, I go to the gym at least 3 days a week for about an hour and focus on weight lifting.  I also ride my bike, and lately I've been walking all over playing Wizards Unite.

I feel so much better than I did 65 pounds ago.  At this point I can hardly imagine how wonderful 200 might feel, and I plan to find out!",1

Three and a half months ago I started strict Keto at my cardiologist and primary care physician's recommendation after a sudden, dramatic, and to this day - unexplained water weight gain this past summer. No cause was ever determined, and the problem quickly dissipated, but as a result I found the Keto lifestyle and it has been a blessing to me.

My head is significant;y clearer, I am down 80 pounds which translates to an 8 inch reduction in pant size, and with my doctor's blessing, I am no longer taking any diabetes or blood pressure medications.

Down 90 lbs since Christmas! Costco gave me employee of the month & are considering a Keto article of me in Costco magazine!,2990,crg26o,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/crg26o/down_90_lbs_since_christmas_costco_gave_me/,289,1566036467.0,"In my Costco warehouse store I was undisputed the biggest employee in the warehouse before even hitting 30 years old. 6'2"" 380lbs, 44 waist, 4XLT shirt. My health in my opinion couldn't have been worse for my age, high blood pressure up to 200/100, heart palpitations 24/7, acid reflux so bad I was eating tums as if they were candy everyday, sleep apnea, depression, anxiety, insomnia... the list goes on & on.

Fast forward to last year,  we had a employee secret santa gift exchange at my work, and a fellow employee gave me a 2xl shirt. A dozen employees were there smiling and asking for me to try it on... but unknowing to them, I was a 4xl. When I broke the embarrassing admission to them, they said ""No worries, we'll just exchange it for a bigger size"". In that moment I decided enough was enough, a fire lit under me, and I told everyone ""No, I will fit in this before summer, just watch"". Some of them rolling their eyes in disbelief. Boy were they in for a shock :)

It was the day after Christmas that I started (why wait for New Years!? Get going now! :p ), and was all in to turn my embarrassment into a inspiration.

I went years without getting a single compliment by anyone... and it did subconsciously take it's toll on me, and add to this self-fulling prophecy that ""I wasn't worth anything"". Come to today, and a ton of employees at work are complimenting me on the daily, can't believe how far I've come, and now asking me... once the biggest employee in the store... how to lose weight!

Management has been so taken aback by my progress, inspiration, and this entire keto movement I've started at Costco that they gave me employee of the month out of 300+ employees.. and guess what shirt I wore for the picture? THE X-MAS SHIRT!

The head manager just recently asked me to take submit a before & after photo that he wants to submit to corporate level to try to put me & keto into their Health & Wellness section of their internally global Costco magazine. Which is awesome because they are more of the standard American diet philosophy..  eat tons of fruit, whole grains, etc. as well as them offering this high carb things free in the breakroom weekly as part of their ""health program"". So for them to potentially publish an article of my keto journey would be incredible!

I've gone from 380lbs down to 290lbs so far, with a goal of 230lbs (150lb weight loss). Went from barely fitting a 4x down to 2x comfortably. I also have made a goal to pay it forward & help as many of you as possible that have questions!  My blood pressure is back to normal, acid reflux is completely gone, back pain is lessened, but most importantly I am excited for every day of my new found life instead of feeling like I was a young guy just waiting to die. I'm 32 years old now & I haven't felt this good since being 21. If I can do it, you can do it! Make tomorrow better than today, ***YOU ARE WORTH IT***!

I had started trying to lose weight in April of this year. At first, I tried changing my eating habits (started eating ground turkey, veggies, low fat yogurt, calories below 1000), and working out for 2 hours (1 hour cardio, 1 hour strength training) 5 days a week. I quickly became burned out, and saw little change on the scale and my measurements. 

On July 12, I started keto. I did the one-week meal plan from the FAQ page on this subreddit, and I ate that for over 3 weeks. I finally felt comfortable enough to make my own meals and the weight began melting off of me. Between April 1 and July 11 I had lost 22.8 lbs, but between July 12 and October 18 I had lost 50.8lbs! I couldn’t believe it. So far, I’ve lost 4.5” in my bust, 6”(!!!!) in my waist, and 5” in my hips. 

With 73.6lbs gone, I’m over halfway to my goal weight of 154lbs. The “after” photo was taken on October 18, but I hesitate calling it a true after photo, since my journey is not yet complete. Here’s to the next milestone! KCKO. 

Edit: here are more details on my diet/exercise when I started Keto mid-July of this year:

To start, my job keeps me fairly active (I usually get in about 6,000-10,000 steps in per shift, but most of it is sitting at a desk honestly).

Week 1: 3 meals/ day, and [this is exactly what I ate. I ate this exact menu plan for 3 weeks, but added IF after week 1. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/one_week_meal_plan/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=keto&utm_content=t5_2rske) I did *not* exercise apart from my 30-minute walk I take on my break at work each night to help me stay awake. 

Week 2: first half of the week I did IF 16:8, with my eating window being 5pm-1am. Second half of the week I bumped it up to 18:6, since I could never eat past 11pm-ish anyways (not hungry. I work overnights in a hospital, and work 7p-7a, so this eating window worked perfectly for me. I still only did my 30-minute walk. 

Week 3: started 20:4 IF, kept same “workout regimen,” except we were moving the next ~2 weeks so I was a bit more active. 

Week 4: transitioned to OMAD, as it was basically the same as 20:4 since I could never eat after my first meal at 5pm anyways. Dabbled in “extended fasts” which never made it past 40 hours. I don’t know why, but 40-44 hours for me is the hardest time. I used the app Zero at first to track my fasts, but later transitioned to Life, as I just like that interface better. As far as a menu, I started eating foods I knew were low/zero carb instead of meal prepping. I HATE meal prepping. I don’t like leftovers. First world problems. My meals consisted of any combination of steak (ribeye), eggs, bacon, ground beef, broccoli, okra, cottage cheese. I still kept under ~1300 calories, but I never counted calories really, just tried to stick to macros of 65% fat, 25-30% protein, under 15g carbs. I was usually under 9g of carbs. 

Starting in September, I started getting the hang of longer fasts. I only ever got an upset stomach once during refeeding periods, but I had eaten a bunch of sauerkraut, and then decided to walk around Costco. No bueno. Do not recommend. But if you’re in the twin cities area of Minnesota, I highly recommend [Kramarczuk’s Eastern European Deli](https://kramarczuks.com/) , they have amazing sausage and sauerkraut. Just don’t break a 109hr fast with it. 

Fast forward to now: I’ve started easing back into working out with taking walks/jogs around the lake by my house or running on the treadmill at the gym if it’s snowing/too cold out. I’m going to start adding in weight training again, and am probably going to go back to OMAD instead of fasting, as it was hard for me to work out while fasting. Yes, I have tried snake juice, no I will not continue to do it, no matter how many times that guy in the video calls me a fatty, haha. 

What has worked best for me is to just keep things simple. I don’t make crazy keto recipes, although they look amazing, because what I’ve been doing is satisfying to me and works for me. If it doesn’t work for you, try something out! Thanks to everyone for your amazingly kind words.

I haven't checked the citations he used, but....what are y'alls thoughts on this?

**EDIT:** I have read the references from the book on that topic and ALL of the references that he gives in [this video](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/eat-more-calories-in-the-morning-to-lose-weight/) where he comes to the conclusion that you burn more calories at breakfast. 

Most of the papers are behind a paywall, but luckily I'm a biology professor and can get the full articles.  Of the 8 references on that video (some were from the book also), there was only [one](https://nutritionfacts.app.box.com/s/h0jasvygtcxvqddsgzf9y9ak3amaarrd) (not behind a paywall, but also only 1/2 page long) that suggested that weight loss was greater after eating breakfast.  

BUT there were so many red flags and caveats: 

1. 1. the study is from 1975
1. there were 6 people in the entire study (4 men, 2 women)
1. there are no details about what was eaten, just that it was 2000 cal at ONE time
1. they did this for only 2 weeks total (1 week at dinner, 1 week at breakfast, no time between treatments)

The other papers he cites (at least on the video) all show that some form of calorie restriction at night leads to weight loss *because it decreases the amount of calories the subjects eat TOTAL throughout that day*  So, basically, eat less at night, you tend to eat less overall, which makes sense because most people mindlessly eat.  That isn't what Dr. Gregor was saying though.

I'd love to hear if anyone knows of some evidence to the contrary, but I couldn't find anything.",0

**Has McDougall or anyone else discussed/investigated this practice or something along the same lines?**

I don't know what to do but it's literally driving me insane, I don't know if I could ever get myself to eat meat again because I just don't see it as ethical but I do not feel good or healthy in the slightest.

  


The things I eat day to day are sometimes oats for breakfast if I decide to eat it, usually a vegan shop bought veggie soup if I'm at work and then whatever for dinner - can be something relatively healthy like pasta or curry or could be some form of fake meat with virtually no veg on..

  


Recently started eating some of the shops vegan plant based ready meals which are meant to contain a portion or 2 of veg, I still feel like absolute trash. My body is exhausted after work, I'm skinny fat and I feel tired 90 percent of the time.

  


Went to the doctor a few months ago had my blood tested, never heard anything so iron and b vitamins must have came back fine.

  


I bought the forks meal planner app but find myself unable to make a choice of anything on there.

Trying to decide dinner options paralyses me to the point I can't do anything as I feel like anything I choose isn't healthy enough or doesn't have the right VEG.

  


I constantly feel exhausted and starving when I come back from work and so find myself either eating any old trash or ordering vegetarian Chinese takeaway maybe twice a week.

  


I have a perfectionist mindset so this lifestyle hasn't be good for me. I don't know what to do and I feel trapped as I don't want to go back to eating meat cause of the guilt but at the same time I don't want to be manipulated by the processed shit industry into eating shit.

  


I can't help but feel deceived by the militant vegan agenda, (and I was once part of it) who will seem to frame information in any way to deceive people as long as it protects the animals.

  


I feel like crap being moderately healthy 70 percent of the time meanwhile, all of my friends and people around me who eat meat and dairy all the time are full of energy and (appear) healthy. I don't know who to believe anymore

  


If anyone had any advice on where to go next and what to do about this that would be greatly appreciated. Just to clarify I'm not trying to attack vegans or whatever as I have massive compassion for animals I just feel like in the interest of protecting animals a lot of misinformation might have been spread and used to deceive people.

  


The problem I find with health is that there's so many different causes it could be its impossible to narrow down and data can be used to paint any picture you see fit

I'd love to be proven wrong though so if anyone has any information that would be greatly appreciated.

I look like a deflated hot air balloon naked, but feeling much more self confident in clothes these days. Never thought I'd enjoy working out or hate sweets, but here we are. 

Everyone keeps asking how much I plan to lose. I dont care about pounds, I want body fat low muscle high. The day I'm not overweight I'm eating at a surplus to bulk up. For now, I'm amazed that I appear to be putting on a little muscle while being in a deficit. While, possible i simply toned, it's pretty obvious I'm at the point where the muscle is getting bigger not just fat getting smaller.

I agreed with him on that, even with White Coat Syndrome that blood pressure was way too high. So I promised I would be in better shape the next time I came in. He just nodded while writing in my chart and said ""uh huh..."" Granted, I'm sure he has heard that a million times with no real outcome. But I was dead set on changing my ways.

Cut to this week's appointment. I step on the scale and it was 243 pounds. The nurse then took my blood pressure and it was 145/100 (shit). She took it a second time, but this time she had me talk about my kids. I told her some funny stories and when she finished she said ""see, much better"". The second measurement was 128/85, higher than it should be, but not terrible. The doctor came in, asked me how everything was, did a quick examination, then sat down looking at my chart and sighed. He turns to me and says ""With that blood pressure you have two options: I can put you on blood pressure meds or you can lose weight and exercise"". I had a slight smile under my facemask and asked, ""you mean like the fifty pounds I've lost since I saw you last?"" He furrowed high brow at me, then scrambled through my charts while saying ""YOU DIDN'T LOSE FIFTY POUNDS!!"". Then his eyes lit up and he said ""You son of a bitch. Wow. Good job! Let's keep you off the meds for now and see where you are in 6 months. I'm impressed."" He didn't ask how I did it, but said to keep on doing what's working and we'll meet again in 6 months.

My question is: for the best two years I have had these weird chest feelings. Everything from mild tightness to stabbing sensor to numb left arm,  pins and needles etc. 

I have been checked out thoroughly. Been to the ER, seen numerous GPs, seen a cardiologist, had my blood, blood pressure, heart rate, ecgs, stress tests etc all done various times  and all show up OK. My cardiologist recommend a wear a heart rate thingamajig for 24hrs and do another stress test. 

So I basically went full on plant based a few weeks back were I was really only eating meat like once a week although I did have some milk in my coffee, some cheese and some fish and I swear 95% of those feelings went away. 

I've since been on vacation and hence eating vacation food and it's come back not as severe but it's come back.

Eggs + sore throat?,0,iupmf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/iupmf5/eggs_sore_throat/,10,1600396968.0,"So a few years back a doctor recommended me and my mum to start having an egg daily as we'd usually have sore throats pretty frequently after eating spicy things and also just commonly get colds. We haven't got any more than one sore throat in a year after doing what he suggested, which is why my mum was saying I'd get sick without eating eggs. I've been fully vegan for almost 3 weeks now and this morning I've woken up with the start of what may be a sore throat. It could just be random luck, but I don't think so.

I've been hitting basically all of my nutrients according to cronometer on a regular basis. The only ones that aren't green is vitamin d, so I try to spend as much time outside when it's sunny as possible, vitamin b12 but I do get 70% of the recommended intake from fortified foods and hopefully I'll be able to get a supplement soon, and calcium which is at 80% bc I'm getting 1000mg daily but the recommended intake for teenagers, which I am, is 1200mg. I do try my best to eat calcium rich foods whenever possible, though I can't eat tofu everyday as it is pricy where I live.

Is there a specific nutrient in egg that helps with sore throats that I could try to eat more of that I may be missing?",0

"Electrolyte deficiency on Keto is no joke, I didn't even know I had it while it was silently ruining my life. Heavy legs, poor exercise performance, fatigue, sleep issues - all due to inadequate magnesium/potassium. Weird thing is blood tests came fine so I never suspected it.

What's the fuss? ""Electrolyte deficiency symptoms are obvious and I don't have them"". Also, I did blood tests and they came fine.

Turns out it's not that simple, it's not all or nothing. I'll try to make this as short as possible: I had two Keto attempts, the second time I even lasted almost a year but all the time felt like shit. My running performance came to a grinding halt - whenever I'd go for a run, after 5 minutes my legs felt heavy as lead, it was like moving through molasses. I'd barely come home walking. It was that bad. I rationalized it all as ""my body running poorly on ketones"", as some say that their exercise performance is reduced. Well, mine wasn't ""reduced"", it was almost non-existent.

Also, my sleep was terrible, I would be waking up every hour or so. I was exhausted all the time. There really are no words to describe the oppressive fatigue and brain fog that I was feeling. The thing is, I did Keto because I wanted to improve my health, so I took the worsening as maybe being due to the condition itself.

Eventually, I quit. I started sleeping better, my running performance recovered. However, it wasn't really an improvement, it was actually a reversal to a previous unsatisfactory state, but better than infinite ""terrors of Keto"".

This time, I decide to do Carnivore. Not only beef and water thing, a bit expanded but all animal products and zero carbs. Some herbal teas here and there. There comes my 3rd day, I get into ketosis and, immediately I fall down into the same symptomatology: heavy legs, poor sleep, etc. ""This cannot be happening"", I was thinking to myself. I know it's not just the ""flu"" because it's happening all over again. I go over every possible thing that I might not be doing properly and realize that I'm not taking any electrolytes. I'm 99% convinced it isn't that (I have my labs), but to hell with it, I'm gonna buy some Lite Salt (potassium) and take some Magnesium Citrate, even though for some reason I'm convinced it's all placebo. I made it into a routine to take my electrolytes and didn't think much about it.

Few days after I go for a run, I don't notice anything. The next day, I climb a hill, no issues. Then it dawned on me. ""Wait a second, I'm not having any issues, this is weird. Why am I not tired, why do my legs feel so light?"". Then I figured out that it must be because I was taking electrolytes. In that moment I really felt like a total fool. I put myself through months of needless suffering because I was too lazy (or whatever) to actually take some electrolytes. Because I believed I don't need it.

Now my issues are basically resolved. Simple as that. However, it impossible to describe the magnitude of change that I feel. Life on Keto was misery, now it's actually good, and I enjoy the benefits of Keto on mental clarity, energy etc. Before, it was all ""hard work"", busting my ass to respect the macros yet it wasn't working out and I felt even worse.

There are a few questions, however. **If my blood electrolyte test came fine, how come I still needed to take them?** **Obviously what is measured in the blood is not what really matters.** Also, many people claim that Keto perturbs electrolyte levels so maybe I just need more while in ketosis? I don't really know but here's the thing: don't take it for granted, just take some extra and be sure.

Electrolytes?,1,jfixob,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jfixob/electrolytes/,17,1603334742.0,"Hello
New to Reddit.
Few months in to keto.
54lbs down.
Thoroughly enjoying it.
Totally overhauling my admittedly lazy way of life and cooking from scratch (working from home has allowed me the time and focus) and admitting that my past choices and habits were doing me no good.
However.
I feel like crap today.
Feel asleep for the duration of a work’s call.
Sparked out again for my entire lunch break.
Felt a bit ropey when I woke up.
Decided to bin work off super early and have my main meal early to try and combat the queasy feeling.
Fell straight back to sleep for two hours straight after.
I can’t say I’ve ever really experienced keto flu.
I can’t work out if I might genuinely be coming down with something or if this is what I’ve been lucky enough to avoid up to now.
Having been obsessively looking things up on here when unsure I feel relatively confident I’m either actually poorly or it’s an electrolytes issue.
So, on to how to get my electrolytes balanced?
I see lots of people saying they take this or that but when I go to look up what they’re recommending it contains sugars of some sort so then I get stumped as to what to get, paralyse myself in to inaction and don’t get anything at all.
I cannot do broth. I’ve never been able to deal with soups and broths even though they always smell lovely. The mouth sensation of hot savoury liquids is just not for me.
I’ll put my hands up and say that I rarely add salt to my cooking. Cut that out nearly 30 years ago when weaning my son and now if I’ve salted a meal it’s too much for me.
So, I’m looking for a product I can purchase.
I struggle with water consumption (as in I don’t enjoy it, it’s feels a bit acidic if I burp etc but I’m nothing if not stubborn so it is consumed even as I’m cursing my choices) so it’d be great if it was something I could add to some of my daily water intake just to give me something different to drink.
Is there a product that doesn’t contain glucose or the like that you could recommend?
I am in the UK so some products that get mentioned I can only really find on Amazon.",1

I applaud  anyone who starts a journey of becoming a better human from any point physically because it begins in the MIND.  Can't change OUT without changing IN.

Everlywell results...so bummed out,2,atdhto,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/atdhto/everlywell_resultsso_bummed_out/,19,1550841397.0,"I haven't drowned my sorrows with cheese, but IF the tests are accurate, I might as well restock my fridge and pantry with all the things I threw out at the beginning of the year.

I had my blood tests done one year ago when I was eating animal products once per day (Bittman's Vegan b4 6). All the meat we ate I purchased directly from a small farming family. I'm 7 weeks on WFPB, and I took advantage of the Everlywell sale to check on things before I see my doctor who wants to put everyone on statins. In a previous post I said I'd post my experience and results.

I did the test on Friday, February 15, and sent it out in the mail on Tuesday the 19th. Today (the 21st) I got a text saying they received my test and to expect results in 5 to 10 days. Amazingly, I received another text a few hours later saying my results were ready.

The testing experience is great. Everything from the packaging to the instructions is intuitive and well-designed.

BUT

My cholesterol is UP from 235 to 243 mg/dL.

My triglycerides are UP from 150 to 163 mg/dL.

My HDL are DOWN 59 to 58 mg/dL.

My LDL are UP 146 to 150 mg/dL.

I tried not to get my hopes up when I sent in the test. I have lost weight, but every single value went in the wrong direction. My husband did a test as well, and he fared better, lowering total cholesterol by 20 points. Still, these are not the amazing results we read about.

Since hubby's values are better, he's going to go to the regular lab for a blood draw in the next week or two to see if the tests are similar. I'll go for my regular office visit sometime in April to renew my scrips, and I'll have to get tested again.

I'm not giving up on this yet. Before we took the blood tests, we signed up for the women's health seminar with the Esselstyns in March in Cleveland and their Asheville retreat in June. I was confident that by June we'd be at the coveted 150 total cholesterol and that going would be more of a victory lap - reinforcing habits and learning new skills.

Before it is asked, we have cut out oil. No oil for 7 weeks. We still eat nuts, nut butters, and avocados - not every day. I add at least a tablespoon of ground flaxseed to one meal each day. We've tweaked our favorite hummus recipe to be oil and tahini free, though it's not as good without tahini.

The irony is that I've tended throughout my life toward a WFPB diet. I've often said I could live off nuts, seeds, fruit, and veg. My husband grew up on meat and cheese.

TL;DR Everlywell was a great testing experience, but 7 weeks on WFPB has resulted in blood lipids that are worse than one year ago. Still staying with WFPB at least until April when I'll get my formal blood draw at a lab.

Edit: I'm aware that the next step - after verifying the accuracy of the test - is to keep track of everything that we eat. I posted not so much to ask what I'm doing wrong/what can I do better but to update as I promised about the home testing. My results are discouraging, but I'm not about to give up at this point. ",0

Thanks everyone for your thoughts and suggestions! 

I think my next plan is to ease in to wfpb very slowly, try to identify any triggers, and take a probiotic in case it's biome related and my body needs help growing the right germ buddies with increased plant/fiber intake. 

I'm also considering eliminating snacks, to give my mouth more of a break too. I may have been snacking too often when I tried wfpb in the past, possibly leading to gum irritation.

Exogenous ketones for energy and mood,0,8x2msv,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/8x2msv/exogenous_ketones_for_energy_and_mood/,32,1531096298.0,"I'm doing Keto for the emotional and mental gains, and I've been nothing short of thrilled with the results. 

Last night I treated myself to Chinese Food. After researching which dishes are low carb, I chose MU Shu pork (sp?).  Was delicious and I ate the entire quart.

This morning I woke up groggy and depressed. Bullet Proof coffee often helps, but not today.

I was so out of it, I went back to bed for an hour. Woke up feeling 1% better. Test strips confirmed my suspicion... I was out of ketosis. 

I decided enough is enough and went to Walmart for exogenous ketones to see if that would help.

Within minutes I was back to awesomeness. Ready to take on the world! I'm sooo thankful for that as in the past, I would fast in order to return to ketosis quickly because depression sucks balls. I fought it long enough that I have very low tolerance to depression now.

Super thankful and thought I'd share.

Edit to add: I do keto to help with depression. I actually started keto underweight because I didn't eat when depressed / stressed.

Meds helped my depression for a while, but everything has a tolerance. After decades of meds, I decided to try keto and it worked better than any med I've taken.

It's been 4 months and I stopped meds after 1 mo keto with no relapse. With exception to when I get knocked out of ketosis. Then I'm depressed as balls again until my body returns.

Exogenous Ketones may not help those who are losing weight. But I've run into several others who appreciate what keto has done for their depression and thought I'd share my experience.

I understand it to be that it's the process of burning fat that creates ketones. If your in it to lose weight, taking ketones won't help. Gotta start with burning fat :) ",1

Experiences/ Advice wanted!,1,j8e7j6,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/j8e7j6/experiences_advice_wanted/,5,1602332979.0,"Hey guys! So I have searched the internet but haven’t found an answer yet, but I’ve been doing keto for maybe three weeks now, and I have been all anxious about my macros off and on (terrified of gaining weight) but every calculator I use spits out approximately the same numbers give or take a few grams. I am not huge but I could stand to lose some body fat (I get referred to as skinny fat a lot 🤷🏼‍♀️) 

Anyway, I pretty consistently hit my protein, come in at 70-80% of my fat intake and on a bad day 1g over my 19g carb intake. I’m doing a 20% calorie deficit as well.

My scale is broken and I haven’t been able to get a new one yet (essential worker but on my list for my one day off tomorrow) and I feel great but still look the same (bras are a bit looser,typically wear leggings) and I know I know I didn’t put the weight on overnight and keto isn’t “magic” it’s a lifestyle not a diet and I am committed.

I guess the question I originally wanted to ask was to anyone like myself who was never big but overweight for their height and age if it maybe took them a little while longer to notice weight loss visually? 

ALSO I bought the ketone strips but heard they’re inaccurate and before I buy a blood tester is there anything physically I should be looking to notice aside from weight loss to know I’m in ketosis? 

Thank you for reading all of this if you got through it! 😊",1

I was able to get all of 2 potentially useful notes out of it, and it was the first keto document i looked at.  ya'll must have someone here who can come up with a better introductory paper.  that one is weak, and a poor representation of your doctrine.

edit:  I was asked for specific criticisms...  Let's start with organization... as it stands, it's kind of a loose collection of questions and answers.  As we all learned in college english, a good report follows a format for a specific reason, and that reason is to express your knowledge in an informative, organized fashion.  the tools are, very loosely,  'state purpose', 'express broad idea' and then 'express specific details', and wash rinse repeat as necessary, until you've explained all that you set out to explain.  there isn't much of that.  I'm not adverse to the Q & A format, but the A's leave a lot to be desired.  there is just simply no sense of overall organization and presentation.  it's a loose amalgam of words, surprisingly low on facts. 

there are also a lot of what i would call 'inside jokes'... except they're not jokes.... apparently keto-ers have a fascination with bacon, and eggs, which makes sense, but they are referenced without any real context... heck, even the drink water reference has no real context, and isn't explained in any detail at all... it just leaves readers with a vague idea that water is important, and what person in the world doesn't know that?  it makes no reference to any sort of biological uptick in water consumption during the ketogenic phase.   ""insider references"" are fine, if they're given context, and explained.... 

The question about bad foods isn't really informative, and doesn't even really answer the question.  my understanding of keto is that it isn't really part of the organic vs. non-organic argument (i.e., the frankenfoods that are mentioned), but it's supposed to be all about physiology and making the body operate on energy stores, not energy intake... but the whole 'paragraph' avoids the perspective of what the keto does/needs from it's food sources, and sounds like a retarded vegan clamoring against.  My instinct wants the question 'are there bad foods out there' answered with examples of foods that opposed, stall, or work against the ketogenic state, not some altruistic nonsense about go local, go organic... While i whole-heartedly agree with go local go organic, that ain't got nothing to do with ketogenics, so my understanding goes.

*I'ma stop here, and not keep on tearing into it.  my point is this... if it's going to be ya'lls 'go-to' explanation of what you do, it needs to be re-written with facts and organization.  not someone's  stream of consciousness brain-dump, which, let's be honest, is what this is.*

Face Gains - 7 months Keto and 102 lbs lost,1729,7v6iz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7v6iz4/face_gains_7_months_keto_and_102_lbs_lost/,153,1517777011.0,"https://imgur.com/a/Ocj0S

I started Keto the end of July 2017 and am down just over 100 lbs (almost 3 of my 3 year old). I have PCOS and Hashimoto’s which makes losing weight difficult but Keto just works really well for me! I don’t want anyone to get discouraged if they aren’t losing this fast. I don’t think my experience is typical. 

A lot of this was no exercise, but I started exercising about 2 months ago. I do 30 minutes cardio and 15 minutes strength 3 times a week. I also chase a tiny dictator around (my 3 year old) but not sure of the actual calorie burning potential there. :)

I keep things pretty simple with food. Very little Keto sweets or baked stuff. I do intermittent fasting and have 1 main meal (normally fattier meat and veggies or salad) plus snack on cheese and salami and nuts (Brazil and macadamia). I like to snack and I’ve been successful if I keep it to the evening so I haven’t curbed it. I also can’t manage enough calories in 1 meal anyway. If I exercise in the morning or am hungry I have eggs or noatmeal in the late morning. I don’t track religiously anymore, but sanity check it occasionally and I’m at like 1800-2000 calories, 20 net carbs. ",1

This is what fats, dedication, metric tons of water, no sugar, and light exercise looks like on me.

No, I don’t track macros. I didn’t start Keto solely for weight-loss purposes, but it ended up being a wonderful side effect of sticking to the lifestyle. I wanted to make the transition into a Keto lifestyle as seamless and easy as possible. I fully understand that some/most people need to track to stay in line. I’m not saying either way is wrong or right. I just found success in eating whole, nutrient-dense food was enough to keep my satiated and to not over-eat. Doesn’t mean that I don’t pig out on bacon and in-n-out occasionally. I just found a healthy balance for myself.

Also, a huge NSV. I went on vacation to visit family from Saturday until this last Wednesday, so 4 days total. We rented an airbnb and I cooked dinner every night we were there. There were a couple of meals that we ate out but this is the first vacation I've taken that I've actually stayed keto!

My weight was up .2lbs but I attribute that to travel+being on my period. So that is a huge victory because most of the time I come back with 10- 15lbs of water weight!

As soon as we got there I started smelling the kettle corn, seeing the signs for Apple cider- there were three food stands offering fresh squeezed lemonade, shoestring fries, ice cream, apple cider donuts, tons of BBQ. I immediately started bargaining with myself ""why did you start yesterday when you knew this was coming? You can always start tomorrow! This could be your last hurrah!"" 

But there will always be something in the way of success. This lifestyle is not for the faint of heart, especially in the beginning. I told myself if I still want it when I'm skinny, I can get these things another time, knowing full well I won't give a fuck about sugar by then. I made a commitment to myself, my wellbeing, and my health. I want to sleep better, be happier, focus more, and of course, look hot at my best friend's wedding, in May lol. 

I went with a smoked chicken leg (dry rub), I asked to make sure there was no sugar in the rub. I did my due diligence, and once I wasn't hungry, anymore, it all became a little easier. We went through a corn maze, picked pumpkins, fired apples out of a cannon, fed some cute livestock and bought some farm-fresh cheeses :D we went to a brewery after- i ate more cheese, drank water, got to watch ny boyfriend and our friends relax and let loose and i drove everyone home after.

I know I can do this, because I've done it before and been successful at it. I was just naive in the end- no control with my transition, gained it all back and then some. Maybe thinking I could transition was the problem. Idk. But right now, im pretty proud of myself, reddit. So excited for the SVs and NSVs to come!

Fallen off the WFPB wagon - need a little help,25,ik8cl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/ik8cl0/fallen_off_the_wfpb_wagon_need_a_little_help/,15,1598942512.0,"My wife and I made the move to WFPB years ago after a cardiologist basically gave me a death sentence. I can say with confidence that this diet saved my life!  
Now, with the pandemic and working from home we've strayed. As I work from home my hours are longer... there's no cut-off point where I pick up my car keys and drive home. By dinner time I'm exhausted and don't feel like really cooking - so it's been a transition into Beyond Burgers, Gardein and lot's of other quick, 'plant based' but very processed meals. We still avoid oils, meats and dairy, but I'm seeing a ton of starches have crept into our diet.    
I feel terrible now. We've gained weight, stamina is declined, all the health benefits we've gained are slowly disappearing. Have to stop this now before I find myself back in the cardiologists office waiting for ""news"".  
Anyone have some really hearty but easy WFPB meals to share? Pumpkin chili is on our list, along with a good zucchini pasta. But most of the Forks over Knives recipes we used to make are simply impractical now - spending 45 minutes in the kitchen each night isn't going to happen.

I have about 25 pounds I want to lose after the initial 7 I've lost already. I cut my calories in half (a bit more than half, really), which was shockingly easy since I was apparently overeating by a lot.  Apparently for a short guy who stares at computer screens all day for work and play, 3K(+) calories a day isn't good. Replacing energy drinks and soda with low-cal caffiene and water was a huge part of that.

I live an extremely sedentary lifestyle, and fast food is convenient to my job. I'm currently eating quite a bit of fast food in extremely controlled amounts, but I want to give keto a try. Does anyone have any good low-carb meals I can get from:

- Chick-fil-A

- Taco Bell

- McDonald's

- Zaxby's

- Wendy's

- BYB

- Domino's

etc.

I'm lazy and am not an expert in the kitchen, so I'd love it if I could use fast food to give keto a whirl. 

I just had 770 calories of one of those specialty chicken dishes (fried chicken, cheese, bacon in disappointingly small amounts) from Domino's for lunch, but I don't know how many carbs are in the chicken breading. But no carby bun or fries, so that's a step.

What is your go-to lazy keto meal?

Edit: Just had CFA 12 grilled nuggets with a side salad with ranch (all broken up and mixed together), and a water for dinner. 570 calories, 14 carbs, oddly satisfying meal. If I can keep doing meals like that, I'm set. $9+ though. Ouch.",1

Considering I’m no expert at cooking, these are pretty convenient to make. However, I’m starting to get tired of making these, and I want to try something new. The first thing that came to my mind were buckeyes. I did some google searching and found this recipe.

https://40aprons.com/keto-buckeyes/

These look pretty delicious. However, I’m running into issues. I use the MyFitnessPal app. I entered all of the ingredients into the “create recipe” and divided it into 50 servings. The nutritional facts were way out of wack compared to the website. Instead of there being 2 grams of fat, 1 gram of carbs, 1 gram of fiber, and 1 gram of protein per serving, the nutritional facts came out to 7.5 grams of fat, 2.6 grams of protein, and 12.9 grams of carbohydrates. At first I wondered if the servings were just off, but the recipe’s ratio on the website from fat to protein was 2:1 while MyFitnessPal was 3:1. 

Did I make a miscalculation on MyFitnessPal, or is this online source not really credible? Thank you in advance for any feedback! Much appreciated!",1

I've been (mostly) whole food plant based for almost two months now. My biggest problem has been getting enough protein- especially since I'm trying to lose weight and therefor have also been restricting my calories (1200-1400).

Through a conscientious effort, I've been able to scrabble together around 30-35g most days. Which by all advice, is not enough. I don't feel bad or tired per say but it still worries me. I've also become a bit more active- though no lifting or intense strength based training. The asterisk, though, is that I've introduced protein bars or protein chips which are not whole food (to supplement the bit of whole food plant based protein I do get- mostly from my daily bean/rice/salsa/corn bowl). 

Anyway, I'm looking for high protein, low calorie lunches that can be meal-prepped. I'm also not much of a cook (which has never been a problem with my unrefined palette), so easier/simpler is better.

Any additional protein-related advice would also be helpful. And if you're wondering, I've already lost 20 lbs so far!

I felt great when I did it I dropped nearly 30lbs in about 12weeks and my confidence was super high. Now I have no motivations. Anyone else struggle in a similar way? I'm disappointed in myself and I guess asking I'm for help?

UPDATE:
Thank you all so much for the encouragement! Just a little updated. My wife and I will be eating Keto friendly tonight. One of my biggest worries was that she would be hesitant to restart it as well. However, I brought it up and she enthusiastically agreed that we should begin again! Again, thank you all!

UPDATE:
Two meals in and about to be a third. Mindset has already begun to change again. I'm stoked to be eating the way I know I should have been the whole time. For those who may have been struggling the way I was please read through these comments. A lot of times it only takes one meal to regain the love you may have had for keto! 

Thank you all!",1

I felt miserable by the time the night ended.  Woke up this morning and weighed at an even 226. Yikes, four pound jump!  However, I think it was a blessing in disguise.  It puts me back in the mind set of focusing on watching what I eat and obtaining my goal of 190.

"Finally at an ""average weight"" (pics of 85lbs lost)!",2318,9w3z4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9w3z4r/finally_at_an_average_weight_pics_of_85lbs_lost/,101,1541973650.0,"[First pics](http://imgur.com/a/15NTttx) so you don't have to read my story :)  
ETA: scroll down in that link for more pics!    
  
I am officially considered an average weight for my height! I am weighing in at 144lbs and I am 5'4"". No more being overweight!  
  
Although I didn't start Keto until January 9th, 2018, I consider my true weight loss to have started right after Thanksgiving 2017. I decided to cut out bread and sugar (I didn't know what Keto was at that time) and I figured if I could make it through the holidays without temptation then I could really commit. I was probably more than 230lbs at my heaviest but I didn't have a scale, I was scared of the scale, so I use 230lbs as my starting point. The last time I had weighed myself before starting Keto was actually May 2017, I was attempting to start a new diet/workout plan; I was 225lbs. I gave up after just a week or two. Then hurricane Irma happened in September 2017, damaging my home and I ate all the time to cope with the situation of having to find a way to repair my mold ridden, broken home while having to move to a small one bedroom apartment with my husband, son and our two dogs and cat. I felt lost not being able to take care of my home (insurance companies are a joke, just saying; we are still fighting it to this day). I was a chronic snacker, and I hated cooking because I think I resented not having my own kitchen and utensils, etc. so we picked up drive-thru often and binged on crap food all the time. I'm sure I gained quite a few more pounds because I truly lost sight of myself, my life, the way my son and my husband would need me.  
  
So after seeing the first photo of myself in that white and blue dress from November 15, 2017 I knew I had to try harder this time to lose the weight; I honestly thought I looked okay that evening...yikes. I was also constantly suffering from headaches, high blood pressure, and just no motivation for anything. After Thanksgiving, I started eating better and by the time I discovered Keto in January 2018, I had lost about 15 pounds already; I was basically already doing Keto without even knowing it, so the transition was easier than I thought. We got back into our home in May of 2018 which has really helped with my progress!  
  
**What I did that I found helpful for my situation:**    
-I weighed and tracked everything I ate until July because I finally got comfortable enough to not have to track (and I've continued to lose another 20lbs since then)  
-I never had a cheat day to this day (saving that for whenever I can have a vacation, hah!)  
-I did do intermittent fasting most days, usually only eat between noon and 6pm. I have been easier on myself with that more recently.  
-I weigh myself everyday.  
-I truly couldn't have been this successful if it weren't for this subreddit and /r/xxketo as well.    
  
I don't miss bread, the thought of it actually makes me feel full! I do miss Cheez-its and some desserts but my self control is truly a 180 degree difference from one year ago! Sorry for how long this was and thank you for sticking with me if you made it this far,  KCKO! <3",1

I had a spouse who regularly threatened me, controlled me, and manipulated me. So, I ate. 

Now, I'd always been a big guy all my adult life (over 300 lbs), but when I was eating to cope, I ate so much, that one day when I stepped on a scale, I realized I had ballooned up to almost 350 lbs. 

I had done Keto once before, very successfully, so I wanted to start again. The last time I only stopped because my spouse demanded it. 

Well, this time I stopped listening. Not just about the food. I took my life back, filed for divorce, and ate what I chose to eat. 

I didn't even buy a scale. After moving out, I had very little. I slept on a folded up blanket on the floor for the first month. I had to make sure my child had everything he needed, first. A scale just wasn't a priority. I was eating Keto because it made me feel better. The number didn't matter. 

I don't track my carbs or my calories. I just stick to low carb foods and I eat when I'm hungry. That's it. 

So, in an effort to get some sort of furniture together, I went down to the Salvation Army store. And on the shelf there, there was a bathroom scale. 

I thought, ""I've never been under 300 lbs, in my adult life. It would be awesome if I was down to 299 by now."" 

So I got on the scale, just to see, with clothes and shoes and everything. 

I was convinced it was broken. I ended up having to ask someone else to stand on it (someone who knew what they weighed) to make sure it worked. 

I'm 279 lbs. I don't even know how to process that. 

I'm getting my life back, slowly, and it is hard to think about all the time I wasted not doing the things I needed to for myself. But this is one I will stick to.

Flax seeds - Can you overdo a good thing?,2,9i5feo,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/9i5feo/flax_seeds_can_you_overdo_a_good_thing/,7,1537701020.0,"https://flaxcouncil.ca/resources/nutrition/general-nutrition-information/flax-in-a-vegetarian-diet/prudent-use-of-flax/

**Prudent Use of Flax**

Small brown flax seeds and flax meal signal goodness and add a nutty flavour to your foods. Flax seed offers plenty of health benefits for vegans, but is it safe to eat? Can you overdo a good thing?

Cooking or baking with flax is a perfectly safe practice. However, when raw flax is added in large quantities to diets that do not contain a healthy mix of foods, health problems can develop. Adopt the following strategies to ensure health problems do not arise:

Balance your diet – Be sure you eat uncooked flax as part of a balanced diet. For healthy people, who consume raw ground flax seed daily in a balanced diet, no health problems are likely. 1 You must be diligent about eating a varied diet in order to supply the body with enzymes. Enzymes supplied by other foods protect against the buildup in the body of unhealthy compounds.

Illness from eating too much uncooked flax seed, in a diet with little variety, can arise because flax seeds are among 12,000 plant seeds 2(cited in 1) , such as almonds and cassava, which contain moderate amounts of natural compounds called cyanogenic glucosides. These glucosides occur naturally in many plants. A 1993 study by Cunanne 3(cited in 1) of healthy, female subjects eating 50 grams (1/4 cup equals 45 grams) of flax daily, showed no increase in glucoside buildup.

In an unbalanced diet, one which is based mainly on a plant containing cyanogens, a concentration of the cyanogenic compounds can build up in the body, leading to unpleasant and, on occasion, life-threatening reactions. Such a buildup has been documented in populations relying solely on a staple such as cassava in their diet. In these cases, the illness-causing deposits were not blocked by enzymes supplied by other foods in the diet.

Cook a portion of your flax seed – Cyanogenic compounds are made harmless by cooking. Thus, eating cooked foods, such as muffins that contain flax seed, is quite safe.

An analysis of muffins containing 25 grams of flax each, showed no detectable levels of cyanogenic glucosides after baking for 15 to 18 minutes at 230°C (400°F). 4(cited in 1)

Be careful about your iodine intake – Vegans must also be alert to another potential health problem that can occur. The cyanogenic glucosides found in flax can interfere with the way the body uses iodine. Lack of iodine can lead to goiter. Your concern should be greatest when the level of iodine in your diet is low. 5(cited in 6) Iodine requires an Adequate Intake of 150 mcg/day 7 , and availability varies. In Canada, 1/4 tsp. of iodized salt provides 67 mcg of iodine. In the United States, only some table salt is iodized. In Britain, no salt is iodized. (7)

I'm 53 , 5' 5"" and I weighed 294lbs, I've lost 14 to 15lbs, my goal is 170, and my irrational goal is 130. 

I've had issues with food since high school. I was anorexic but with help I got better. I had rules to follow, but of course to keep control, I made my own. 

I've been married now for 32 years and have 3 kids all grown up. I gained a lot of weight with 1 and 2, and I'd finally lost it all and found out #3 would be joining the family. 

Back then, I had a metabolism that worked. I knew how long I could go without eating. I'd eat whatever the kids were having, birthday cake,  all of the bad things knowing I could not eat  for a few.days and stay the same size. 

Then karma showed up and smacked me upside the head. She stole my metabolism in my 40's. I denied what the mirror said and ignored the larger sizes I had to buy. 

All those years of reckless eating and then starving myself got me to this weight and its a habit I cannot seem to brake.

I know fasting is somewhat okay, but because of my history with food I'm feel like I'm falling back into the trap again. 

On top of this I have IBS and I'm lactose intolerant. I'll eat fish (not tuna) turkey, chicken, hamburger meat and ham/bacon. I can eat small portions of cheese, 1 or 2 slices of thin cut cheese, a tbsp of sour cream or mayo, but that's all I can handle from dairy land.  

I refuse to eat most vegetables, if they are green that's a definite no. Except Claussen pickles, I love them. 

So all this is to say, I'm having a really hard time finding things to eat. I got frozen cooked shrimp and I've never had problems eating them until now. When I eat them now, my stomach cannot handle them and I don't know why. 

I can cook, but if I do, I can't eat what I've cooked, it makes me nauseous. 

I've been eating turkey and cheese roll ups, boiled eggs, canned chicken, 2oz hamburger pattys all of which I like, but after 3 or 4 days, it makes me so nauseous I can not physically make myself eat one more bite of them.

I'm ending up with unintended fast days until I'm so woozy, I'm forced to eat something from above. 

I realize all of this is a huge personal problem but I'm at my wit's end. I'm so frustrated and hungry and I absolutely refuse to give in and eat the easy food.

Could the shrimp issue be from the diet and my body adjusting to my new way of eating? I've run out of ideas for things to eat and stay inside my plan. 

I'm using Myfitnesspal and I'm staying under my carb limit of 17. I've made my proteins and fat somewhat equal, with my proteins a little higher. My calories are at 1280. 

I'm committed to this new lifestyle, if anyone has in suggestions, I'd appreciate it very much.",1

For NOOBS,1,1g76ry,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1g76ry/for_noobs/,9,1371078826.0,"OK…here goes.

I have been thinking about this for a while and I figure its finally time.

No more talk about how fat everyone is.  It’s a threat to our economy and our sovereignty.  Check.

I am going to tell you why we are fat and how to fix it.

We are fat because we have insulin.  Insulin does one thing…it lets sugar into cells.

What’s the problem?  

Insulin is the enemy.  Let me explain.

The problem is that we eat too much sugar.  

Don’t lose me here.  This is important.

Sugar is a single particle.   Bread is a chain of sugar particles.  So is pasta, rice, potatoes, crackers, and just about anything “white and bready”.  All just strung together sugar particles.

It soon as it hits your stomach acid it breaks apart into….you guessed it….pure sugar, which then goes straight into your blood.

Your body then produces a SH*T ton of insulin to suck it out of your blood and into your cells.

Your cells can only burn off about 10-15% of it.  So, your body puts the rest of that sugar in fat cells.

You think this takes a day ?  Two days ?  5-10 hours ?

NOPE.   This all takes about 15-20 minutes !!  Our bodies are very, very good at it.

So, in 15 minutes, we are sitting with a SH*T ton of insulin still in our blood, looking for sugar to suck up, but is all gone…and we have, ugh.  Low blood sugar.  Which means…hungry !

So, what do we do ?  We go eat some bread or pasta or crackers.  And then the whole thing starts all over again, with 85% of what we eat going into fat cells.

Sugar, in all its forms, is the enemy.

This is why diets based on will power don’t work.   “Just eat less” they say.  That is total Bullsh*t.  If you try to eat less, but you still eat mostly bread, crackers, pasta, rice, or potatoes, you are going to be hungry all the time…again – every 15 minutes.   You are going to constantly be battling your willpower not to eat because you are in and out of blood sugar highs and lows.

This is madness.  Stop doing it.

How do we stop this ?  What is the solution ?

Remember ?  Insulin is the enemy of will power.   Do NOT excite the insulin monster.  He will crash your blood sugar, fill up your fat cells, and make you hungry all over again – every 15 minutes.

If insulin gets excited over sugar (in all its forms) then you have to stay away from sugar.

You have to give your body something that takes a long time to break down into an energy source.    Something that tip-toes around the insulin monster, never waking him up.

There are actually three things that work…and the key words for all of them is COMPLEX MOLECULES.

Sugar is a simple molecule of just a few parts and it is easily and instantly activated by stomach acid.

Fat (butter, peanuts, cheese, olive oils…etc.) is complex.

So is meat protein.

So are many bean proteins.

Your body has to work at getting these converted into energy.  It has to break out some wickedly complex enzymes from your liver to go after these and tear them apart so it can use them.  It’s not quick.

And insulin ignores it completely, which is why these foods are a WIN.

So, you scarf down some fat, some meat, some peanuts…and your body takes whacks at it for a while, gradually turning it into fuel for your brain and your muscles.   And, the cool thing is, it’s never turned into sugar.  It is turned into ketones – the caveman’s energy source.

Great, so you are eating only fat and protein.  What’s the big deal ?

The big deal is, you DO NOT HAVE TO BATTLE YOUR WILL POWER.  You don’t get hungry.  You eat because you figure you probably should.  You don’t see food as entertainment anymore.  So, as a result, you eat less, without thinking about it or meaning to.

And then….the weight….comes…off…

NO GYM.  NO RUNNING.  NO SITUPS.  NO EXERCISE OF ANY KIND.

OK…bottom line….stop all sugars and starches….start fats and protein. 

Eat less than 20g of carbs per day….and do not cheat.   

Read labels…count carbs.  Do it and WIN.  Don’t do it and fail.

How will your body react?

Well – not very well at first.  Your liver had not been exercised.  It knows how to produce those wicked enzymes for fat and protein consumption, but it is not tooled up to produce them in buckets.  

It takes four days.  Maybe 7.  But usually four.

In four days your liver will be fully spun up and working well on fat and protein. 

It is a freaking miracle.  

By day 5.  Your mind will clear.  You will stop being sleepy.  You will feel like running up the stairs.  You will feel like superman.  And you will not be hungry or thinking about food.

That’s day 5.  Days 1 through 4 will suck.  THIS IS THE ONLY PERIOD where you will be battling will power.  Your body will not know what to do with the fat and protein and it will be screaming for carbs.

Crunch through these four days and you are home free.

The bad news…if you cheat.  You have to do those 4 days all over again.  DO NOT CHEAT.

How fast will you lose weight ?

I went from 230 pounds to 193 pounds in 3 months !

AGAIN.  NO GYM.  NO RUNNING.  NO SITUPS.  NO EXERCISE OF ANY KIND.

When  I got to 185, I found that it the weight loss slowed down…less weight to carry around I guess…so I was burning fewer calories.

Only then did I start exercising.

That got me down to 175 over a few more months.

Only then did I have to start counting calories.

Now I am down to 170, with 5 more pounds to go.

This works folks.   

You will see a lot of comments tearing apart my medical knowledge, which is not great.  And there will be a lot of discussion about ratios of protein and carbs and fat.

All good stuff.  But its in the weeds.

The important points are that you CAN NOT BATTLE WILL POWER.  

This way of eating eliminates that BATTLE and gives you weight loss that lasts as long as you stay with the method.

Oh, and BTW, your blood work will look fantastic.

Good luck !

So this can especially add up fast for little kids with their much smaller bodies.

It's all about how much fructose is hitting your liver at any one time. Not a problem when consuming fruit naturally. Smoothie or juice? Problem. Sugar in your oatmeal, not as bad since the oatmeal will slow absorption some.

What isn't clear to me yet is whether this only applies for the most part to people with a lot of body fat or not. because all of the studies that are showing these problems are on standard American diets and are probably suffering from the same overweight situation that most people suffer from. So it would be interesting to see if this applies just as heavily to healthy weight people. Maybe someone has a study showing just such a thing in normal weight people too?

Have any of you who eat a generally whole foods plant-based diet low in fat, and who have low body fat, but eat a fair amount of refined sugar, checked your liver enzymes or whatever they are that show that you have a fatty liver or you're developing one?

I've never tried a ketogenic diet, but I've been in mini ketosis after exercising. I'm now doing a 5 day water fast and I'm in full ketosis and I am enjoying it alot. I have a lot of mental clarity and focus. Granted, I'm not sure if this mental clarity sticks when eating ketogenic, but I'm assuming it must to a certain degree.

&#x200B;

I've been trying to be plant based a few times in the past, but have had trouble with:

* Exercising intensly and having energy
* Mild migranes
* Energy slumps
* Not gaining muscle weight

Being in this fast I realize part of the problems must've been caused by improper electrolyte balance due to exercising intensly.

Have you experienced these issues with energy levels? Have you managed to replicate the keto mental clarity and focus on a plant based diet (which is a helthy carbs, but high carb diet)? How?

There are people who believe that everyone deserves to make their own choices, and do whatever makes them feel good.

That kind of message also does not belong in /r/keto.

Similarly, you wouldn't go to /r/atheism and talk about how God is love and we need to put Christ back into Christmas and whatnot.  The message's truth or untruth is irrelevant; it's simply an inappropriate venue for it.

Ultimately, the people in /r/keto are here for support in sticking to the keto lifestyle.  If you personally find that 90 carbs a day isn't a problem, and you can cheat two meals a week, and you can slip in and out of ketosis easily with no consequences, and you lose weight despite it all, that's fantastic for you.  However, just as a light drinker shouldn't preach moderation to a zero-tolerance group like Alcoholics Anonymous, someone who is NOT following the keto lifestyle should not come to the /r/keto subreddit and advocate for abandoning the core philosophy of the keto eating habits.

Fun note: I did NOT realize it was exactly 4 months from my first run till after I ran it. That was such a special surprise.

I ran into a few struggles, like for one, I was FASTING at this run, about 20 hour fast because again, the plan was to not run a half marathon haha! I also was lacking hydration as I just woke up and didn't drink any water. Also, I wasn't sure how I was going to do with fat as my primary fuel source for a 2-3 hours run... But alas, I was able to do it and I did NOT feel tired after (I did feel sore as hell, but not tired!)

This has been a dream of mine for decades... As a former fat man, a half marathon just seems impossible. But if you take anything away from this post, is that ANYTHING is possible if you put your mind to it. This is definitely one of the shining moments of my life.

Here is a pic of my first run 4 months ago, and of my half (as well as before/after pictures of my weight loss journey on keto). I will ride this high for MONTHS, I guarantee it!

For those who lost weight on WFPB - how long did it take?,19,ib3z2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/ib3z2p/for_those_who_lost_weight_on_wfpb_how_long_did_it/,28,1597653313.0,"Just looking for some insight!

Been a junk food vegan for 6 years, but trying to transition to as WFPB as possible. Kind of loosely following starch solution, so starch + veggie heavy with lower fat while I'm trying to lose weight.

I have a history of eating disorders so counting calories isn't an option for me, and I'm trying to work on slow + sustainable weight loss. But I'm just curious what some of your experience has been losing weight with a WFPB diet, where you started (since people with more weight to lose lose more quickly) and how long it took.

To be clear, I'm sticking with WFPB for the foreseeable (at least 95/5 with processed vegan food) just because I feel so much better on it. But I'm also hoping to lose weight with it, and want to keep my goals realistic. Please share your stories!",0

I purchased Brewer's yeast by a company called Kal, and I put 1 cup of it in the blender, bc the recipe says 1 cup of nutritional yeast.

Free Soda at the Office,1998,77ecbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/77ecbe/free_soda_at_the_office/,214,1508448228.0,"I’ve been at my company for five years now and we’ve always had free cans of soda available to the employees.  It’s a corporate office so it’s a sedentary job and the last thing I want to put in my body a carb bomb in in a can.  During my first three years the office admin would always ask why I was drinking water and why I never took advantage of the free soda.  I would always politely explain that Diabetes ran in my family so I was watching my sugar.  
After the third occurrence of her noticing me guzzling water instead of soda she asked once more why I wasn’t taking advantage of the soda and I explained that there was just too much sugar in there for me.  She’d rebuttal with how diet coke is healthy because it’s sugar free.  I thought of spewing about how I didn’t want to drink all of the chemicals in it so I told her I appreciate it, but that I prefer water and seltzer.  Well that was the buzz word for her.  Seltzer.  It’s as if she felt like the mother hen in the office and there was a chicken she wasn’t tending to.  She added a case of seltzer onto her next delivery of soda and I was thrilled and very thankful.


In our office fridge there are 6 can dispensers.  3 Cokes, 2 Diet Cokes, and 1 Ginger Ale.  When the seltzer delivered she demoted one of the Cokes for a seltzer.   


Time has gone on and I haven’t really thought much about it, but slowly other employees would begin indulging in seltzer and appreciating the different flavors and we would run out of seltzer and people would ask her if there is anymore.  And slowly over time she would have to increase her order volume for seltzer water.  


I felt compared to share this story because I just got a cup of coffee in the fridge and someone was deciding if they wanted something out of the fridge and for the first time it hit me: 
6 can dispensers, 3 of which are now seltzer, 1 coke, 1 diet coke, 1 ginger ale.  


It doesn’t seem like much, but it feels good to have swung the popularity in this office and to see many of my colleagues putting less refined sugar in their bodies.

Well it has been almost exactly a year since I’ve started living this way and I’m down 100 pounds.

This is one of the best decisions I’ve made in my life. Keto is a secret weapon that serves me well.

Since I’ve been on Keto, there is a plethora of benefits that I’ve seen (which may or may not be just from just the weight loss, but still there nonetheless). My confidence has increase, libido increased, ability to do physically demanding tasks more efficiently, hunger has decreased, energy has increased, neuroticism has decreased, sleep has improved (no more sleep apnea and snoring), no more bloating/food comas, not getting sick as often (may or may not be because of keto, but I haven’t gotten sick since being on keto), and having the option to skip meals without it being miserable.

Although this diet takes a little more maintenance (keeping water and sodium intake high and knowing how many carbs everything has) than a regular way of eating, like I said, it makes it worth it because being in ketosis is my preferred state now.

Edit: Thanks for the silver 🙏🏼

Edit: Wow thanks for the platinum 😁

From 340lbs to ONEderland!,2597,cxhsk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/cxhsk4/from_340lbs_to_onederland/,228,1567204602.0," [https://imgur.com/a/U18zvLv](https://imgur.com/a/U18zvLv) 

I hit ONEderland today!!!!!  🙌  I weighed over 200lbs when I was 15 years old and spent most of my adult life over 300. ONEderland seems like some unattainable dream when you're 340lbs. I remember setting 199 as my Fitbit goal and thinking ""Yeah okay Chelsey, that's 140lbs away. Good luck hoe.""

No wraps, no pills, no surgeries, no gym. Just food and a commitment to myself. I am proof that you don’t need to beat yourself up over a few extra carbs, grabbing fast food or not getting your cardio in. The ONLY secret is patience and commitment. I'm just a regular ass girl with a regular ass job living a regular ass life. YOU can do this too.

Important note: I am celebrating a goal that I’ve worked 18 months to achieve. I’ve never tied my self-worth or happiness to my body size and you shouldn’t either. A number on the scale should never make you feel less or greater than. I was a genuinely happy person and felt plenty fuckable at 340 pounds. What I didn’t feel was HEALTHY. I had high blood pressure, a rapid heartbeat and had just lost my dad to heart failure. I felt like I would have been lucky to be alive in my 40s. Obviously looking slimmer is a huge motivator for weight loss, but my main focus was to not die young.⠀ 

My timeline went like this:

2/19/18 – 340lbs. The day I started keto.

6/16/18 – 299lbs. 1st goal reached. My first time being in the 200s since my mid-20s.

11/17/18 – 250lbs. 3rd goal reached and I was fucking hyped. Onward to 199 hoe!

2/15/19 – 240lbs. Officially lost 100lbs in 1 year. Plateaued for 3 months and stayed between 240-250. Still hyped. Still focused.

 8/30/19 – 199lbs. 4th goal reached and I am so fucking proud of myself.

Next Goal: Hit 170lbs so I can LITERALLY claim to be a “KetoHALFasser” 😂⠀",1

Edit: Sorry for leaving out some pertinent details, but I’ll try to address some common questions that seem to be popping up:

1. Yes, loose skin is a bit of an awkward problem. At this point I’m just going to deal with it and not try to have surgery. It’s mostly in my stomach. 

2. I used a meal replacement product called OptiFast and did weekly visits with a dietician and a doctor at an approved health facility. They monitored my progress, drew blood periodically and made sure at certain milestones that nothing went haywire with my heart or anything else. My experience was pretty smooth in that regard. 

3. After a bit, I was in a mild form of ketosis. As I understand it, when calories are as limited as mine were (800/day), you can have more carbs and still effectively be in ketosis. I think combined the five 160-calorie servings had like 75 to 100g of carbs per day. 

4. I had my gallbladder removed in 2015 so that wasn’t an issue for me. But when doing this kind of very low-calorie diet, that can be a major concern. I know people sometimes have to take meds to regulate their gallbladder when doing OptiFast. 

5. I feel 1000x better doing everything now, including eating and exercising. My general quality of life has drastically improved and I’m working on feeling more confident in my own skin (that part is the hardest). 

6. I try to walk 2-3 miles per day and am starting to do some muscle-building. 

7. I meal plan like crazy now. Cook large quantities of food and divide them up into meals for every week. I don’t count calories so much as I count quantities of different foods now (ounces of veggies, starches, dairy, fat per day). I’ve been back to eating food for about 2 months now and I feel pretty in control. I’ve had bad days and good days in maintenance, but the number one thing I try to remember is that they’re just days. They don’t have to ruin weeks, months or years of work I have put in or intend to. 

8. I’ll try to answer other stuff that pops up as I can. Remember I’m not a medical professional too, but the reason I posted is because I know other people’s stories gave me tons of hope and I want to do the same. Pay it forward, essentially. 

9. Thank you so so much for all the kind words and advice. It means a lot to me. I want all of you to succeed in achieving whatever your health goals are because I know how much achieving and working toward mine means to me. 

10. I used OptiFast shakes, soups and bars, five total servings a day. Usually one bar, two or three shakes and one or two soups. ",1

Thank you to this entire sub-reddit for being so inspirational, welcoming and knowledgeable. When I first came here, I knew NOTHING about keto. When someone mentioned keto to me, I thought it was a type of martial art. For all you newbies, I encourage you to read the posts, read the FAQ and immerse yourself. Your dreams CAN come true if you just allow yourself to accept the possibility that it can be a reality.

**Supplements/Medicine**: For medicine, I am currently taking Allopurinol and Levothyroxine and have for years. At one time, I was taking Pravastatin, Metformin and/or Kombiglyze and that has all ceased. I was diagnosed at a T2 diabetic and now all those symptoms are gone. For supplements, I am taking Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, Vitamin E, Orange Triad multi-vitamin, PhosphatidylSerine (at night to aid with sleep), Turmeric Curcumin with Ginger (to aid with inflammation), Fish Oil, 350 mg Magnesium, 1250 mg Potassium and 5000 mg Sodium.

**Blood Tests**: My fasting blood test as of this mornings weigh-in was as follows: 75 Glucose, 33% HCT, 11.2 HB, 2.5 Ketones. I use the Keto-Mojo equipment you can find on Amazon and test at least once a week.

**Food/Macros/Micros**: At first, I tried to eat a wide variety of foods so I wouldn't feel bored with my selections. After awhile, it just became as hassle to have to track macros for each recipe and variation of it. The fact that I would get bored with my food made me readjust my mindset. I made my life more interesting and fulfilling with food becoming an enjoyable way to fuel my body. After a few months, I narrowed my food choices down to allow reasonable management of the tracking. As of today, my staples are Ribeye Steak, Filet Mignon steak (rarely), Blue Diamond Wasabi, Smokehouse or Salt/Vinegar Almonds, String Cheese, Fat Bombs, ChocZero 50% Dark Chocolate, Salted Peanuts and Dry Rub from Buffalo Wild Wings. This encompasses 90% of what I eat, with the random Caesar Salad (no croutons) or Double Stack from Wendys (no bun) tossed in from time to time. I do drink Diet Coke Zero and sparkling water. Every single day, I drink 144 oz of water - no exceptions. The only macro I track is carbs and always stay under 25g. I am confident the rest of my diet is dialed in pretty good. I eat about 1800 calories a day, 900 each meal.

**Exercise**: Due to past knee injuries, I didn't exercise until I was under 300 lbs. Need to protect those joints. Once 300 lbs came and went, I started to lift weights 2x a week (full body, strength-based program) and play basketball. I also spend 15-20 minutes in the sauna after I exercise.

**Fasting**: I do a 16-8 IF every day, but have done 20-4 or 24 hours. I eat at 1PM and 8PM pretty consistently.  If I am eating OMAD due to life getting in the way, that will be at 5PM.

**Goals**: My entire mindset changed during keto and I now try to live a goal-based lifestyle aimed at achieving all my dreams. My gym goals are to dunk a basketball and bench press 350 lbs. I have also set financial and travel goals for myself. All these goals are handwritten and tacked to my wall so I see them every single day.

**Motivation:** You need to take total responsibility and accountability for your happiness. If you are not happy, get off your ass and do something about it. Every single day when I wake up, my mindset is that I want the freedom to do what I want. For me, discipline equals freedom and keto is my discipline.

**EDIT**: I few people requested a chart of my weight loss. I only have partial data from 63 weeks starting at about 400 lbs. I've seen some of you create amazing charts, but my poorly formatted one is posted below.

Fruit on Dr McDougall/Chef AJ Maximum Weightloss Diet,6,hwz40r,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/hwz40r/fruit_on_dr_mcdougallchef_aj_maximum_weightloss/,3,1595613761.0,"Has anyone done either Dr McDougall and Ched AJs maximum weightloss programs? How much fruit did you end up having on it?

I’m close to my goal size but am at a plateau. The only thing I’m not fully following is having more starches than fruit. I don’t binge but I do eat a lot of fruit. This is because I love fruit incl bananas and I just naturally want to eat more of them than potatoes or rice. But I’m willing to try liking potatoes and rice more if it will help me get over my plateau. I’m also not sure why starches are better than fruit for weightloss - I think if I understood why, it would be easier for me to stick with it.

Just keen to hear your experiences ❤️ thanks ☺️",0

Frustrated to the point of tears figuring all this out...,3,52va49,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/52va49/frustrated_to_the_point_of_tears_figuring_all/,12,1473958322.0,"Listen, I already know I'm an idiot, but I'm trying to figure all this out and would greatly benefit from some help here. 

See, most people who are keto pros don't need to come here asking for tips, advice, and help. So I get it: you hear the same questions over and over again, and some of them seem annoyingly obvious. I know that's frustrating. But there are very few welcoming places on the internet for newbies (and oldbies) to support each other. I literally live in the Middle East--no on here has heard of keto (including the doctors, okay?) and this is my only place to come for help and support. 

I'm getting really frustrated with the conflicting stories, advice, and data on here. 

For example, some people write up their experiences like, *""Oh don't eat this or that sweetener, be careful doing X or Y--I did it and it kicked me out of keto!""* Which is great advice. Thank you for sharing internet strangers!

**But how in god's name do you know that this one thing kicked you out of keto?**

Because, see, the general dogma around here is that ketostix are complete bullshit, don't even measure the right kind of keto, and aren't even accurate with what they DO measure anyways. 

Lots of people even go so far as to say that the blood measuring tools aren't very reliable. So how accurate or truthful can users be when they're like, ""Oh that kicked me out of ketosis!""--like, how the hell do you know? 

The other thing that's frustrating me to the point of tears is the **""Oh just stay under 20g carbs and you'll be fine""**--OKAY. For someone who has been doing this for 6 months, understands the limits of their physiology, has a rotation of recipes down pat...this is very good, simple advice. 

For someone who has no way of measuring if they are in ketosis, is constantly trying new foods they've never eaten regularly before (almond flour, artificial sweeteners), may have to sub ingredients in recipes based on what they have or can afford, THIS IS NOT HELPFUL. 

**Also, isn't ketosis about WAY MORE than just 20g carbs?** Too much protein, not enough protein, sugar alcohols, and a host of other things can affect ketosis. So why do I see this piece of advice repeated over and over to newbies without any thought or consideration put into their actual question?

**Aren't we all trying to work together here?**

I'm frustrated. I'm spending HOURS a day planning recipes, meticulously calculating, measuring every single gram of food I put into my body, and apparently ketostix are bullshit and I'm an idiot for even thinking I should use them. In the mean time I still have to continue to live life. And even for a meat eater, staying under 20g has been very much a process and a challenge. 

It's been a week. No weight loss, no magical appetite changes, no symptoms of ketosis whatsoever. Am I doing all this work for nothing? How do I know I'm in ketosis or check if something may have affected it? I'd like to know if I'm hitting the target or not, so I can alter what I'm doing appropriately instead of blindly going around without any understanding of what the fuck I'm doing. 

Please someone help me understand how I can check to make sure I'm in keto.",1
Fuck,2,t3761,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/t3761/fuck/,32,1335992229.0,"I have no idea what to do now. 

I'm really fucked.

I'm a 20 year old type 2 (pre)diabetic who is underweight. I figured this out around last October.

I started a loose version of keto around then, and carried through until around December when I snapped, and binged for like 2 or more weeks on the absolute worst shit. I got my blood work done in January.

Total: 221
Triglycerides: 66
HDL: 53
LDL: 155
A1C: 5.7

This was directly after my vicious binge, and I was sure that keto would clear things up for me.

I ate primarily beef and chicken, lots of cheese, butter, olive oil, fish oil, green vegetables, and mostly kept under 30 carbs ( sometimes under 40). 

I just got my bloodwork back after 10 weeks of that.

Total: 264
Triglycerides: 92
HDL: 49
LDL *197*
A1C: 5.4

I have no idea what to fucking do now. I want to believe this diet is right, maybe I'm just fucking it up somehow. If I eat any differently my blood sugar will get destroyed, so it's either fucking heart attack or death by amputation now.

I didn't exercise really, but still.. I wasn't exercising that much before either.

When I first started Keto, I used to think about writing a post when I hit my goal weight all the time. Now that I'm doing it, it's completely surreal! I started Keto on 3/29/17 at 180 pounds (short girl here - 5'3""). It was the heaviest I'd ever been. As of 1/15/18, I surpassed my 125 goal and hit 123.8! 

&nbsp;

I am like most of you. I've spent the last 15 years + (my entire adult life!) trying to lose weight. I had tried every diet in the book from shakes, to juicing, to low calorie, to vegetarian bordering on vegan/raw. I tried spinning, running, weight lifting, HIIT, workout videos, everything! No matter what diet or exercise routine I tried, I just could not find anything that stuck. I was a major emotional eater, which led to binge eating. Food was pretty much my solution for everything. People would tell me that I just needed to eat in moderation and that if I deprived myself, I would never be able to sustain it. But I literally craved binging more than the actual foods I was eating, so I didn't know how to not binge and not feel deprived. On my last attempt at losing weight before Keto, I was in a weight loss competition at my gym. I counted calories and worked out like crazy, but it seemed like my body would just not lose weight. I finally started alternating between juice fasts and egg fasts in order to lose the weight and win the contest, but obviously that was not anything sustainable and I gained it all back (plus some) as soon as the contest was over. I felt completely hopeless and I thought that all of the years of dieting had finally screwed up my metabolism like everyone said it would, and now I would no longer be able to lose weight. On top of that, my mind was completely burned out on the constant dieting and I just had no willpower or determination left. I was to the point of pretty much just resigning to be overweight. 

&nbsp;

I don't know what made me start Keto on 3/29/17. It's the first time I ever just started a diet out of the blue. Normally I would have waited till Monday and binged on anything and everything the weekend before. 3/29 was a Wednesday and I had already eaten a high sugar breakfast that morning. It was completely out of character for me to start a diet in the middle of the day, but for some reason, I just decided to make a healthier choice and eat a salad rather than go get fast food for lunch like I normally would have. From there, I just made another healthy choice for dinner. Then the next day I started tracking in MFP and watching my calories and carbs. After that, I used the Keto Calculator to calculate my macros and I was all in. Keto has been life-changing for me. I still love food and I enjoy everything I eat on Keto, but I don't need it the way I used to. It doesn't run my life anymore. I am so proud to say that I have not binged once since I started! 

&nbsp;

Just like everyone else, I had stalls, weeks where I didn't lose, weeks where I could tell my body was holding on to water, etc. While that can be tough, I just stayed consistent and kept going. I tracked everything religiously and didn't cheat (aside from a planned splurge on Christmas day - 9 months into my journey). I am definitely Keto for life! It makes me feel great and I still get to enjoy food without sacrificing how I look and feel. I am still debating whether I want to lower my goal weight a few more pounds, but I'm going to eat at maintenance for a bit and shift my focus to building muscle. I've been lifting since October, so I am going to continue that and see if toning my muscles will get me where I want to be. If not, I may go back to a deficit and lose a little more. 

&nbsp;

I wish I had tried Keto so much earlier. I wasted all of those years on bad diets that made me feel terrible. Almost as soon as I started Keto, it just felt like this is what I was supposed to be doing all along. If you're on the fence about starting, just do it!

Gained 60 pounds on keto during the quarantine. Bad food choices?,0,j5osub,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/j5osub/gained_60_pounds_on_keto_during_the_quarantine/,22,1601950965.0,"Hello keto fam! I'm new here but am experienced when it comes to everything keto.

My husband has been on keto for just under 2 years now. He lost nearly 100 pounds compared to his starting weight. Fast forward to just over 6 months after the lockdown started, he gained just over 2/3 of it back. 

He worked in an office and got laid off at the start of the lockdown. He kept busy at home with personal projects, but I also noticed he would go to the fridge and often mindlessly eat.

I do carnivore keto myself and make him stuff that jives with both of our diets. This zero -carb pizza is my go-to: [https://www.food.com/recipe/zero-carb-pizza-518670](https://www.food.com/recipe/zero-carb-pizza-518670) . Working at a grocery store, I also bring home lots of cheese and cook lots of bacon. 

He is a really picky eater and it is a struggle to get him to eat vegetables. I got sick of him buying greens that he says he will eat and then having them spoil in the fridge, so I just gave up. He's also obsessed with sausages, pork rinds, and ribs. I bring him steaks often, too. His lunch go-to is a keto meatloaf recipe.

He always had an overactive appetite, so I put him on the keto diet hoping it will suppress his appetite. I don't have a weight issue myself - really doing it to increase energy, fitness gains, and eliminate unnecessary cravings. I wonder if the food choices I am making, especially with the high dairy content I consume, are limiting his keto gains. I do not see any signs of him going out and cheating, either.

I am finding that my family is unwilling to adjust the menu or even add some thing WFPB for me to eat at family parties, holidays, sunday dinner, etc. I get comments like ""once in a while wont kill you."" - so I eat what is offered and spend the next few days fatigued, with stomach pains and most of the time I even wake up to acne the next day.

I am a people pleaser and avoid conflict at all costs, and have a hard time speaking up for myself.

I have reached the point of ""if they cannot honor my way of eating, then I wont go!"" 

I always bring a dish to share, because that's just etiquette but now I find myself having to bring my entire meal to my in laws on sundays because all they can come up with for me is iceberg lettuce with store bought dressing. They love me dearly and I them, but they refuse to open their minds to whole foods. Same with my own family.

We have a rule where I will go out to eat with her once a month and order food where as typically when we go out to eat I bring my own prepped meals in a container but the point is to get me to TRY the sushi. 

Any advice?



EDIT: We talked about it. Me and her have a different idea of food, she see’s it as comfort and friendly and I view food as a business partner. 

Ultimately. I’m not eating sushi with her. I’ll be bringing my prepped dinner for the day. 



Thank god.",1

Giving up on keto,0,2pbnjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/2pbnjj/giving_up_on_keto/,11,1418642425.0,"Well, I gave it the old college try.

I'm not an excessively heavy person, in fact, my BMI is about 25.1 (barely into the ""overweight"" category), but I have put on about 15 pounds recently and I wanted to lose it.  I had been attempting to just cut down on portion sizes, go for daily hour-long bike rides, in addition to cutting calories down to 1600/day.  I didn't seem to be losing weight.  I have successfully lost weight before (at one time I was about 20 lbs heavier than I am now), but this time nothing seemed to be happening, despite doing the exact same things I had done in the past.

So then I decided to try the keto diet.  I work in nutrition, so this was a massive shift in my thinking.  I was well-versed in what 100 calories look like, as well as portion sizes, so I felt like my calorie counts were pretty accurate.  I started just with eating more cheese, meat, bacon, low-carb vegetables, etc.  I noticed a massive burst of energy/heat the first few days or so, but after that, not much changed.  I watched the scale daily.  No changes.  I gave it two weeks.  Nothing.  Surprisingly, I wasn't gaining any weight, but I wasn't losing, either.

I got some advice from successful keto-ers.  I heard it all, and I've tried it all.  Eat more calories (at one time I was down to 1200/day), eat fewer calories (when I was at 1800/day), take out all artificial sweeteners, take out dairy (I was eating whipping cream occasionally), do a fat fast, avoid fat fasts, eat less protein, eat more protein, etc.  

The only time I saw the scale budge was when I was down to 1200 calories/day, eating only a bulletproof coffee twice a day and some chicken and vegetables for supper.  I dropped from 196 lbs to 195 lbs.  It stopped there.  Despite continuing to eat like that, the weight loss didn't continue.  Plus, although I was rarely hungry, I didn't feel all that great.  

I went through the ""keto flu"" and even confirmed with many days of positive Ketostix.  But even still, no weight loss.

So, after 4 months of this, I've decided to throw in the towel.  You probably all think that I must be doing something wrong, or that I have some thyroid disease (I don't, TSH is normal), but despite all that, I think I'm just going to move on and start counting calories as part of a normal diet again.  I think this diet works really well for some people, and for others, it doesn't.  In fact, there were a few times when I actually gained weight on this diet.  Surprisingly, though, not a lot-- that's one huge benefit to this way of eating.

Thanks, anyway, for all the advice and effort from fellow Redditors!  This diet is obviously helping all of you, so I congratulate you and hope you all the best!",1

A couple of you asked about stats, sorry I didn't include them before-

Starting Date: Sometime in May of this year? (Honestly did everything 'lazy' and haven't tracked anything other than weight. I knew if I were to be super strict I'd freak myself out and lose motivation.)

Starting Weight: 216

Current Weight: 146


Edit 2:

I should probably also mention that I started walking dogs for a living (hence the Rover shirt), which was a huge contributor to my weight loss as well. I was laid off from a stressful corporate job last year, but now I'm happily taking care of dogs (and cats) and am walking 3-5 miles a day. If I hadn't started walking dogs, I would've tried to figure out a different way to exercise I suppose.

30M Started in February at 275lbs and hit my goal of 175lbs on Saturday! I’ve been off and on diets my whole life and can’t remember a time I’ve ever been thin, maybe back to elementary school. I’ve got a good friend who lost a lot on Keto so after I had started a regular low carb diet in February I decided to kick it into high gear and give Keto a try starting March 1st. 

I did mostly “lazy” Keto and after a bit figured 25 carbs a day worked for me so the daily things I tracked were my carbs, workouts and daily weigh ins. I used to hate the scale but turned it into my motivation once I saw the results through weekly averages. That’s why patience is so important with this and any lifestyle change. Make sure you understand your goal and what it’ll take to get you there. Set a routine that fits into your daily life and be able to adjust and not overreact when you’ve had a bad day.

Bought “Keto for Dummies” back in March and using that and r/keto really helped me get on the right path so thanks all posters! Happy to answer any questions on food, exercise, whatever, in the comments.",1

Oh my r/keto friends, I can’t thank you enough for this day. Today I hopped on the scale and saw 149.4 - so in fact I have now lost 51 pounds in 310 days. This has been so life changing for me. I’m 43, perimenopausal, hypothyroid, and in birth control (for the peri) so I thought I was doomed to be overweight. I had accepted it. I had bought the plus size clothes. I told myself I was healthy because I exercised and ate vegetables. But I wasn’t. I felt awful. I was achy and sore and bloated and uncomfortable and one day I saw a man drop dead of a heart attack in a trampoline park and was like NOPE. I have to do something. I knew low carb had worked for me in the past but I found it hard to sustain. I still craved carbs. I was searching for different variations of low carb and found this sub. Wait, I can have cheese, I can have dry wine? And something about the binary nature of keto clicked for me. Either I’m doing this or I’m not. Then it was off to the races. I decided to judge myself by how well I stayed Keto - and aimed for a streak of logging in on MyFitnessPal. I focused on the inputs. Yes weight mattered but I tried not to let it stress me out. 

10 months later, my spouse has joined me and also has lost almost 50 pounds as well.  We both see this as a way of eating for life. No desire to go back to carbs. 

Now I need to set some new goals. I kinda don’t want to lose too much more because I really don’t want to have to buy new clothes! So I think I will try to maintain or very slowly build muscle and lose a little more fat. 

I visited this sub pretty much every single day. It sustained me and gave me inspiration and support. Thank you to BigTexan, rpizza, sassytaters, JuneStrawberries, anbeav, and many many more. Thank you to everyone over 40 who hangs out here, thank you to all the souls brave enough to post pictures. KCKO 4LIFE! ",1

So I have a ton of health issues. Lyme, Hashimotos, and PCOS. I was vegan for six years before I started getting really sick two years ago and all of my doctors told me Paleo was going to ""cure"" me. Fast forward to this year - when we realized the high fat diet was making me sicker and putting me at risk of diabetes. I had originally lost weight on the diet - but something happened with my hormones this summer and I packed on 30lbs in a month.   


So I said f\*ck it to my doctors recommendation of just trying to stay paleo and I went back to my vegan diet. Im about a month in - I eat very healthy, no gluten, no sugar, minimal oil, and I make everything at home - lots of quinoa, oats, and fresh greens - but I have been suffering from my calves and feet swelling dramatically - and I mean DRAMATICALLY - like I cant even fit my shoes on.   


Im not sure what to do and my doctor isn't much help. Has anyone else dealt with this? Im also taking magnesium, I take a daily raw multi vitamin that has all of the essential vitamins I need - and I exercise regularly  - minimum of 30min a day.",0
Going from running 10 miles to walking the same distance to burn 3.5k calories while on keto,0,4lna7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/4lna7e/going_from_running_10_miles_to_walking_the_same/,28,1464600860.0,"[LONG POST] my apologies!
I've been running 10 miles on the elliptical every day for 2 months or so, which only burns about 1.5k calories. I wanted to change over to walking the same distance (on a trail, not in a gym) to burn more calories though obviously it will take a much longer time- however this burns about 2700-3000cal for me at a moderate pace, I could walk faster (I have short legs=small strides=many steps). 

I have been on and off of keto for around 5 months (fruit/smoothies are my weakness) but I'm planning to stay strictly under 50g carbs per day. My hope is to potentially lose a pound a day. If I only had 5-10 pounds to lose I would worry this could be a problem however I have around 30-40 pounds to lose. I am 23 and 5'3 at 175-180ish. I would be sure to eat plenty of protein and include weight lifting to keep my muscle mass intact (I estimate I have about 20lb above the 120lb suggested for my height) but if i lost a bit of muscle its not the end of the world. My question is this: since this is not a very intense or demanding exercise and I do not mind walking/hiking for hours a day, should there be any problem? I know the 2 pounds per week goal but from what i have seen it is a general guideline or to keep people from being discouraged, you can lose weight faster. Since I am on keto I'm hoping the slow burn of walking will be almost all body fat. Does anyone have experience with faster weight loss and/or hiking/walking on keto? Should I carb up one day to refuel (CKD)? I was also considering walking a shorter distance and doing HIIT but that is very demanding and tiring so i might keep that to 2-3 times a week. As long as I am not falling over tired or getting sick, is there a reason to reconsider this approach? I can't really find information online about this.

[Edit]
There is a reason I want to lose the weight so fast: I have simply run out of time. I have about a month to lose it, I wont mind loose skin. I could fast and exercise less if it would be better for my health, but I am looking for a way to lose fat quickly. I am aware that there is no magical solution to lose fat really fast, however I am wanting to put the effort and work into it to make it happen if this is sustainable.",1

After a week on it I didn't feel much different aside from being less hungry.  The weight loss was almost immediate.  It was a dream come true.  I had started at 220lbs and I was down 10 lbs before I knew it!

I continued on and for a few more months I was nearing my goal weight (175lbs).  I was hovering around 180-185 and I stayed there for a while.

I was feeling energetic.  My head was clear.  My meals were no longer bogging me down with that disgusting feeling that I ate something I shouldn't have.  I noticed the changes in my BO, but it didn't seem to bother my girlfriend (which I am completely thankful for).  She didn't even notice it, even after I brought it up.

Then about a month or so ago I started to feel very tired.  I would get pins and needles in my extremities.  My routine went from getting home and starting up dinner to getting home and napping.  I started drinking low calorie gatorade and chicken broth to get my electrolytes back up.  I picked up some b-complex vitamins, magnesium, and potassium pills to hopefully balance me out but it didn't really work.

I had made an appointment with a doctor to see what the heck was wrong with me, but closest date was a few weeks away. 

Then after a few weeks of low energy, the issues moved from my extremities to my abdomen.  I had a general feeling of nausea that hung in my belly for days.  My sides started to hurt.  During that time I had made an effort to lower my fat intake and introduce carbs back into my diet because I just couldn't deal with it anymore.

I am feeling better now that I have returned to eating some carbs along with more fruit.  I went to a doctor and she explained that these sorts of diets (high protein/high fat) are great for quick fat loss, but in the long run they are rough on the kidneys and liver.  I had read that in some of the linked information but I figured it wasn't prevalent and wouldn't affect me.  Especially since everyone's reviews on this subreddit are always glowing.

Luckily I am still young that my body should be able to bounce back from this, but it is still something to think about when getting into this lifestyle.  I know my experience isn't common for everyone, but I think it's important for people to see that there is a possibility of a downside to this miracle diet.

I do not regret doing this diet at all.  It has taught me self-control, and strengthened my will power.  It has changed my understanding of seeing food as a means of endless enjoyment and more as a source of delicious fuel.  

So after 7 or so months of being a Ketonaut, I'm retiring.  Back to being a civilian.  Where my training will continue having me watch what I eat and have a greater sense of portion control.  No 2 for 1 bags of potato chips in my pantry and no endless pasta and breadsticks for me.  I will enjoy my food as fuel and not as an endless party in my mouth.

My sport doctor highly recommended keto he went in a few seminars over the past few years, not only on weight loss, but also cancer, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, high blood pressure etc.

I dropped the carbs 3 weeks ago, i lost a bit of water, and i ate all my macros, but in 3 weeks i have not lost a lot of weight.

At my age i decided to move away from powerlifting, i did one year of stronglifts, but now my body is wrecked... i know lots of people live off squat and deadlift but at some point the body gotta give. I got some prolotherapy in the lower back, one of my knee was cracking silly and hurting and also my hips.... still getting treated for this.

I switch to the adonis index program, its more of a bodybuilding approach with moderate weights, then lifting super heavy 5 x 5.

I am staying on keto i am in ketosis and have not kicked out, but i need to re adjuste, i might be eating too much even if i stay within what the macro calculator gave me.  

My goal is to lose 50 pounds by next summer if i can a bit more. My workout yesterday was awful, energy was way off, and yes i do take my electrolytes.

I just order a pre workout supplement lets see how things go for the rest of the week.

HELP - Questions about Keto,0,jejyqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jejyqg/help_questions_about_keto/,15,1603203848.0,"So I've been on keto for about 3 weeks now. I track and measure everything pretty much to a tee. I never weighed myself at the beginning of keto (completely forgot), but I weighed myself yesterday and I'm 155 lbs. I've been monitoring my blood ketones and I've been averaging around 2.3, so I'm in nutritional ketosis (hit 1.9 at about 5 days). I currently have my tracker set to 15 net carbs, 1200 calories, 75 g of protein, and 93 g of fat. I should mention that I am also vegetarian. I find it pretty difficult to reach my protein goals. I never go over my fat limit. 

I've used the keto calculator and it's saying to decrease my fat limit down to 89 g (i average about 79 so no issue there), bring my protein UP to 83g and my carb limit up to 20g. 

I'm not sure which to go with, or how lenient I can be with my carbs. Sometimes I get cravings for more nuts or something sweet, and I wanna reach for the macadamia nuts or keto ice cream (don't worry, I avoid all of those nasty sugar alcohols like maltitol, isomalt, sucrose, HFCS), but I'll only have like 1 net g left, so I end up not eating anything / having a small bite and feeling super guilty afterward. 

Also, when the calculator is telling me 20g, does that mean net or total? I find it really difficult to stay within the 15g and meet my calorie goal. I NEVER meet my calorie goal. I always manage to get in about 1000-1100 calories. 

I guess where my struggle lies is in the fact that I can't reach my calorie goal without going over my net carbs by 1 or 2 grams, I never reach my protein goal, and overall I find it difficult to be vegetarian and keto. I know there are some people who do vegan keto, which blows my mind! Does anyone have any tips/insight on how lax I can be with the carb limit? If I go over by, say, 5 grams, will it throw me out of ketosis? I've heard that some people will find their *'carb curb'* by incrementally increasing their carbs and testing their ketones, but I ran out of strips / short on cash atm. Also, is it true that if I work out more frequently I can get away with eating more carbs? I heard it in a video but I'm not sure if I can trust that / I wouldn't even know how much more I can eat??

I've still kept up with the blended fruit, oat, nut milk & vegetable shakes for breakfast and lots of vegetables to go along with the animal protein though.

But today was interesting. My blood pressure came back as 104/62, which is really good for me. I've been 120-130/80ish for years and always figured ""well, I'm close to 40, so that's just how it is."" Eating green was the only thing I've changed since my last blood pressure check in May and only for a few weeks.

It makes me wonder if it's worth scheduling a blood panel now, give WFPB a solid month or two, and then have another one done. I could compare it with my doctor to see what improves!",0
Had an interesting chat with an emergency room medical doctor today about keto,1429,7382tf,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7382tf/had_an_interesting_chat_with_an_emergency_room/,262,1506723506.0,"My wife and I were rushed to the hospital this morning because her grandfather fell ill overnight and was in emergency. (It seems he is going to be okay, thank goodness.) We brought some coffee and muffins for my wife's family who had been there since 3am, thinking they would all be hungry, but it turned out they had already eaten.

When the doctor was in the room tending to my wife's grandfather, we offered her and her nurses/fellow doctors/staff the box of muffins and coffees, since we had no use for them and figured they could probably use them. The doctor proceeded to gratefully take the coffees but didn't want the muffins. She explained that she and most of the doctors and nurses were obsessed with the keto diet lately! Of course, this caused my wife and I to light up like Christmas trees!

She was down 25 pounds, her husband was down 35 pounds (and his type 1 diabetes was showing far better stats). She rattled off a number of other success stories from the hospital staff who were doing keto, and how much weight they'd lost and how much their medical stats had been improving.

After she'd finished with my wife's grandfather she stayed and chatted with us for about 5 minutes about how much research everyone had been doing about it because of the stigma involved with being in the medical profession and doing keto. About how it goes against everything they were trained to advocate for when they were learning medicine, but how much they're learning now. She said she's been tracking her cholesterol levels since she started (something her fellow sceptical doctors had warned her about) and it had dropped since she's started! It was really cool to speak to someone in the medical field about it.

In fact, some of you may remember I posted a couple of days ago about the fact my wife is going through a stall right now. The doctor had all sorts of recommendations, one of which was actually to eat fewer vegetables and more fat. Never thought I'd live to see the day. Obviously it was a sucky, frantic morning because of my wife's grandfather's health, but I thought you would all appreciate, as we did, the fact there's a team of doctors and nurses finding health and weight loss in keto, and advocating for it, at least on a personal level. It certainly cheered us up and motivated us to keep going!",1

Had one of the shittiest days of my life. Ate protein bars for basically every meal.

But today was argueably one of the absolutely worst days I've lived through so far. 

Morning: I went on my morning run, a 5K. First lap, a branch hit me across the face, blinding me for a moment. My AirPod Pros, which I had saved for well over a month to buy, the right one fell onto the grass. Spent 45 minutes looking, I swear it's just GONE. Actually devasted about this, as I literally don't have 70 dollars to buy a replacement... And I love to listen to music while I run. Oh well...

Afternoon: Girlfriend thought I was ""grouchy"" for being tired, because trying to just say I didn't want to share her lunch (literally pasta with potato's -_-), and I told her I had a bad day so far. Had a small argument, during which I didn't even say anything, just tried to calm her down. Now she's pissed, and went off to her mother's house.

Noon: Work zoom meeting cut off randomly, boss got pissed.

Evening (so far): Dog ate a xylitol muffin. Had to take him to the urgent care center to get his stomach pumped. I'm sitting in the ER right now

So far I've aten: 3 quest bars, 1 keto bar, and an egg roll in a bowl. (1/3lb of pork, 1/3 lb of cabbage, a bit of onion, lettuce, leftovers). Is it a GOOD diet? No.

But I'm under 20g of net carbs. I'm so tired, close to crying for the first time in years. But I can get through this. And if you ever have a bad day, so can you.

Yesterday I reached 150 pounds of weight loss and it feels amazing! I'll be honest, when I started last May I was skeptical about whether or not keto would work for me. I had tried and failed at so many diets that I believed my body was broken. At over 400 pounds, I had all but resigned myself to a life of poor health and low self-esteem. But seeing your incredible transformations gave me the hope that I needed, proof that it was possible to make a change no matter how much you had to lose. And after dealing with my underlying depression issues, I finally gathered the courage to give it a try.

So this is how I want to pay it forward. If you're thinking about starting your own journey, I'm here to encourage you! Ignore the doubts and negative thoughts that are holding you back and take that first step towards a life of better health. As someone who no longer suffers from prediabetes, fatty liver disease, or high blood pressure, I cannot recommend this way of eating highly enough. Keto has literally been a lifesaver for me.

And for the ketoers already grinding it out, you guys are awesome and inspirational. Your stories, support and suggestions are more helpful than you know. This community has been an incredible force for positive change in so many lives, including mine. Thanks for being here for us.

Also sorry it's long, tl:dr at the bottom. 

July 3rd I had the whole day planned out mealwise: avocado bacon cheese omelette for breakfast, lettuce wrapped bacon cheeseburger for lunch, and dinner was to be smoked chicken with fresh green beans lightly sauteed in butter and some roasted cauliflower. 

Well dinner plans fell through. I was using my mom's electric smoker and it was acting up and dropping temperature while smoking the chicken. What should have been an hour of smoking to cook (it was 6 bone in breasts that were about 1.5lbs each) was taking longer as a result. So I resigned to letting the chicken smoke on low temp over night and my husband and I decided to get dinner. 

We chose a nearby burger place that has a pretty damn decent lettuce wrap technique for their burgers. I ordered a combo because my husband wanted to eat my fries and I ask the drive-thru lady about wanting it lettuce-wrapped and that I wanted a diet Dr.Pepper. I don't drink diet soda often, I mostly drink water and sometimes iced tea and then the occasional ketoade as needed, so I was 'treating' myself by getting soda. My first clue that the night was going to be off was when the lady taking our order asked rather rudely if it was an allergy or preference, now this place will *always* ask this and I have no qualms about it, I've worked food before and I get how it is, but it was the *way* she asked that was rude. I calmly answer that it's a preference and that I'm on a medically prescribed low-carb diet and then we pulled up to the window. 

My second clue should've been how she reacted when she saw me and my husband in the car. Y'know how some people's faces are just an open book? Well I could just *see* her judgement of our physical appearances on her face. We're both overweight. She snidely tells me that if I'm on a low carb diet that I shouldn't eat fries and I respond by telling her that my husband is going to eat them and that if the place had any side options that weren't carb heavy then I would have subbed the fries out for it. She then tells me about their applesauce, but it's sweetened and I've already looked at the nutritional information of everything in the restaurant and know it's not a viable option. We pay and she hands us our food and drink and we check our order to make sure it's correct and then drive off. 

I should've checked my drink. It's been so long since I've had regular soda that I can't exactly remember the taste and with Diet Dr.Pepper I couldn't really tell the difference anyways. It was subtle and I really only noticed it if I was trying both one after the other. I'm halfway through my drink when I realize that it's not diet. I get my husband to taste and he confirms not diet. 

What frustrates me is I'm like 90% sure that the drive thru lady did it on purpose, but when I called the restaurant and explained to the night manager what happened she refunded the meal and then said she'd talk to her employee about her attitude and actions. She calls back an hour later and explains that the employee did it by mistake and didn't mean to give me regular instead of diet and that the manager talked to her about the importance of paying attention to things like that, yadda, yadda, etc, etc, and that the employee was trying to be *helpful* and didn't mean to come across as rude. Yeah, that manager got bullshitted so hard.  

And now I'm in the process of getting back into Ketosis. Ugh, it hasn't been fun. Today's symptoms haven't been bad so far so I'm hoping I'm through the worst of it now. 

Tl;dr Planned dinner fell through and I went out to eat. Rude employee gave me attitude about what I was ordering and more than likely purposely gave me regular soda instead of diet soda. I didn't notice as it's been so long since I had regular soda and the soda I got tastes really similar from regular to diet. Employee faced no consequences. Have to go through the process of regaining ketosis again. *Yaaaay*

What can I do or say to get them to honestly shut the fuck up? The first time I did keto my friends were supportive, but I've since moved to a new place for college and all of my college friends just want me to eat like shit all the time. Is it time for new friends? Or what can I say to get them to leave me alone about my diet? Sorry for the rant. I'm just really upset that they're responding like this to something I'm trying to do to better myself.",1

I have gained weight going plant-based as I seem to be struggling with my macros - too much carbohydrates and not enough protein.  Anyone have tips they can share?  I don’t want to shift away from plant based but my body seems to be struggling quite badly.

I have been tested and I am moderately celiac and have had issues with soy digestion since infancy (they supposedly did some paper on me according to my mom, but I haven’t ever seen it).  Soy sauce is ok, tofu is definitely not.  Tempeh I seem to struggle with too (I thought maybe fermented was the key).

Now, I'm about 50lbs down from my start weight and I still regularly wear L & XL tops, I don't know if I have a set ""size"" yet. Some brands I just need to have larger because, ya know, females.

"Heavy Cream, Cheese, and Half & Half. They all have CARBS",3,4pc1gb,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/4pc1gb/heavy_cream_cheese_and_half_half_they_all_have/,43,1466647012.0,"So I just posted an article that had a ton of heavy cream (or half and half) based Starbucks drinks. But I also feel that more than a few people don’t realize the dangers inherent when it comes to Heavy Cream or Half and Half (I added in cheese cause why not). This is what this post is about. Hope someone learns something they didn’t already know. I certainly know that when I started my Keto journey I did’t realize these things. 

So,* Heavy Cream*. Some people think it's awesome.... Other's think it's not that good. I think it's just something that has to be used in moderation. Too much of anything (especially when it comes to calorie dense food) is not good for you. Especially when it's in a liquid form.

I should stress that many people don't realize that heavy cream has carbs. It does. This is because a serving (1 tablespoon) of heavy cream has around 0.4 grams of carbohydrates which is (based on the FDA) rounded down to zero. Now, I know most people might not drink a ton of heavy cream but when I posted my article about Starbucks drinks someone had went ahead and ordered a tall (12 oz drink) Starbucks latte made with heavy cream. That is (with a couple oz's deducted for the espresso shot and syrup) around 10 oz. Or, more than a cup. And I could imagine someone getting 2 lattes a day. So if you drink a ton of heavy cream (as in 2 cups) a day, then that has around 13.3 carbs. 13.3 carbs + your allotted carbs for a day can be more than enough to push a carb sensitive person out of Ketosis. It is also very calorie dense, with around 821 calories per cup. That’s a ton of calories, especially if you need to watch your calories.

Now, *Half and Half*. Half and Half does have carbs. Yet, it’s also less calorically dense. People don’t always realize that it has more carbs. Half and Half has a little less than double the carbs of heavy cream. So 2 cups of heavy cream has around 20.8 grams of carbs. Yet - since a serving (1 tablespoon) has only 0.6 grams - it is also rounded down to 0 grams on nutritional labels. This carb content can easily push you out of Ketosis. Yet, if you need to watch watch your calories than half and half might be a better option then heavy cream because it has around 1/2 the calories of heavy cream.

Now, *Cheese*. Cheese is something to be careful about. It has very little carbs (as in around 3 grams per cup for shredded cheese), but it has a *ton* of  protein. And immoderate amounts of protein can turn into glucose which has the effect of pushing you out of ketosis. How much protein does it have? It has around 21 grams of protein per cup of shredded cheese. That’s almost as much grams as it’s fat content which is just 27 grams. Cheese is one of the key reasons why some people could stall in Keto. Cheese can also be somewhat addictive due to do with it’s casein content. You could accidentally be trading an addictive substance (carbs) for a somewhat less addictive substance.


I want to convey to Ketogenic people that you have to watch milk based products. They do have a place in a Keto lifestyle. But in moderation. In large quantities they can be addictive, especially high in protein, deceptively high in carbs, and especially calorically dense.

Now, among everything else, I recommend looking at [this](http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm064894.htm) food labeling guide by the FDA. It should clarify why nutritional labels can sometimes lie. I also recommend this [article](https://zerocarbzen.com/2015/10/05/a-high-fat-ketogenic-diet-is-protein-sparing/) to clarify why immoderate amounts protein in a high fat diet is bad.

EDITED: Fixed up some of my writing.

EDITED: To add why I put 2 cups for heavy cream. Yes I know that that much heavy cream is very unusual.",1

"Hell yeah, officially 100 pounds lost on keto.",1582,cf7v5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/cf7v5o/hell_yeah_officially_100_pounds_lost_on_keto/,59,1563573406.0,"So... my top known weight is 360. Found this out in fall of 2014, and I went to a regular CICO diet and did lose about 40 over a course of 6-8 months. Then things got stressful and I had to move because life happens, and I turned back to food as my happiness. Over the next 6 months, I got back up to 347.

&#x200B;

Then I cut it. I told myself there will be a hard week of hunger, cravings, pain... and I went KETO after hearing about it for a while, and weight immediately started to drop. Over the next 8 months I lost like 70 pounds. Things really started to slow down. I didn't really mind, because I felt better and looked better than I had in at least 6 years.

&#x200B;

Things started to level out at about 270, which has been my ""bottom weight"" lowest since I was like 16. I went probably 10 years around that weight, so I guess possibly my body saw it as a return to normal. But I didn't return to my old happens. I stuck with it. I might not be loosing weight, but I maintaining, that is just as important.

&#x200B;

Read that again. Being able to maintain is just as important as losing the weight, because if you can't.... then it is all worthless. So STICK TO IT.

&#x200B;

But yeah, I focused on maintaining for about a year. I thought it would be good to have a non-deficit amount of calories for a while, to help bring my body back up to speed, let skin tighten up, etc. Though, I still did lose 10 pounds over that ""maintain"" year....

&#x200B;

Anyway. So this spring I moved again, but this time for happier reasons, and I still stuck to it. Still maintained.... but then I started thinking that I was finally ready to be lighter than I had been since my early teens. My lowest weight since I was 16 is  247. Ironically, that is the exact number I needed to officially say I lost 100 pounds on keto. It would mean 113 overall from my top known weight.

&#x200B;

So this morning I was at 247, into new territory that I haven't been in 15 years. 16/8 IF has really helped this past week.

&#x200B;

I don't need to worry about maintaining in the near future because my eye is on the prize. 190. So, I guess that is going to be my next update, I'm hoping it will be up around sometime early next year. Who knows, yall might get pictures in that one too.",1

Help me out! Thinking of leaving WFPB and returning to keto due to rising blood sugar levels after about a month,0,9iji3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/9iji3g/help_me_out_thinking_of_leaving_wfpb_and/,130,1537835980.0,"Hey everyone, I really enjoy WFPB but my fasting blood sugar levels have been climbing significantly after only a month of eating this way. I think it's the carbs? I'm coming from more than ten years on keto, which I was doing to control neuro muscular issues without medication following an injury.

So on keto my fasting morning blood sugar was in the 70s or lower. This month on WFPB, those numbers have been climbing. I just hit 100 and 101 the past two mornings after 12-hour fasts. This seems to qualify me as practically pre-diabetic? 

And the blood sugar after meals (taken at the one hour mark and the two hour mark) is often fairly high, perhaps 120-140+, but certainly not below 100 or even below 110 without lots of exercise.  I did not have such high numbers after a keto meal. 

Additionally, I gained more than 3 lbs on a month of WFPB, from 124.5 to 128 (but have now lost one pound and am down to 127.) 

What accounts for this? What is the explanation for this? Are there any medical people lurking who can explain? This WFPB is a sugar and carb lifestyle. Could high carbs and high sugar cause insulin sensitivity? Didn't we all watch a recent popular movie which quoted doctors who insisted high sugar and high carb intake does not cause diabetes, because fat and meat cause diabetes? Yet my levels were spectacular on high fat and moderate meat, but now on WFPB the levels appear to be pre diabetic and headed to diabetes?

I am posting here to get some suggestions from you guys. I will give this WFPB maybe one more week before perhaps returning to keto. I'm really hoping to get advice from this community on how to eat carbs and sugar and bring my fasting levels below 100 forever, and bring my 2-hour post meal levels to under 120.

Otherwise, I can't risk my health and take a chance that high carbs are safe for me. 

TLDR; 55 yrs old, female, 125 lbs, 5'8"" has rising fasting blood sugar in pre diabetes range (100) after only a month on WFPB diet, following a switch from keto where fasting numbers were good (70 or lower.) Needs explanation, advice, recipes.

Help please! Keto isn’t working for me,3,jcjuwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jcjuwq/help_please_keto_isnt_working_for_me/,31,1602916813.0,"I’m 30 years old, 170lbs, 5’4”
I started keto about a month ago in an effort to lose weight but I haven’t had any change at all in a month. Am I doing something wrong? On a typical day I have a hard boiled egg or two for breakfast, some baked chicken tenderloin pieces for lunch, an avocado or two for snacks, and dinner is usually salmon/chicken breast with broccoli/asparagus/Brussels sprouts. 
I use the carb manager app and try to track everything and keep within my macros. The app suggested 1400 calories a day, should I lower this goal? Or am I not eating enough fats to reach ketosis? I don’t know what I’m doing. 

It’s been quite frustrating and I’m feeling like keto just isn’t for me, so any help is very appreciated!",1

I’m quite unlucky to have a body extremely sensitive to ketosis. Every single time I fast more than one day I start to have hideous rash. I can’t post a picture here but I’m 100% sure it’s a side effect of fasting and not eating any carbs for extended period of time. 

When I stop fasting and start eating carbs the rash disappear. I struggle with it for 3 years since I started dieting and every single time I tried to fast for longer time it occurred. 

It’s very painful, usually appears on my chest and if I won’t eat carbs it might go further on my body. It makes me very discouraged about keto and fasting but I really wanna do it, especially for activating autophagy. 

Did anyone also have problem with reoccurring keto rash and solved it? :(

Help! Severe gastrointestinal issues several times (not due to fiber) since following PBD - any ideas why?,1,8s8mkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/8s8mkm/help_severe_gastrointestinal_issues_several_times/,12,1529441651.0,"Hey!

I've been on a WFPB diet for over a year now, and I've had 3 cases of severe gastrointestinal issues since doing so (ironically enough, I've been ill more times with this than when I was eating shit, processed foods before - in fact, I'd never experienced such bad stomach/gut issues before).

My symptoms are:

Sulfurous burps (eggy burps.. which was pretty horrible, and something I'd never experienced)

Stomach/gut pain/ache

Slight fever

Very low/no energy - have to lie down all day

Each time it's taken me 1-3 days to recover from all of these symptoms, so I'd really like to get to the bottom of why I'm getting them, cause it's not nice at all.

I mainly eat:

Fruit (bananas, oranges & berries mostly)

Nuts & seeds (pecans, walnuts, brazil nuts; sunflower, pumpkin, hemp & flax seeds)

Spinach, peas, sweetcorn, green beans, asparagus, broccoli, leeks.

I had a bout of this the other day, but I'd eaten exactly the same things as I had the few days prior, so I'm unsure what the cause is. The only thing I'd done differently is I'd had a kelp tablet for iodine, and some spinach out of the garden.

I thought I'd mention fiber in the title because a lot of people have issues when initially transitioning due to not being used to such a high quantity of it. The reason I don't think it's that is because I've been on the diet so long that I should have got used to eating more by now - or at least I think I should.

Has anyone else suffered from this discomfort/symptoms before? If so, did you manage to find out what the cause was?

I'd appreciate any help/suggestions you could give, whether you've experienced this or not.. I'd rather not go through it again, as it's 2 days of hell lol. Cheers.",0

"Here's a detailed list of keto-friendly foods I eat on a regular basis with pics, tips and recipes [Pics, FP]",3242,529h6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/529h6w/heres_a_detailed_list_of_ketofriendly_foods_i_eat/,303,1473642325.0,"Full Disclosure:

* I don’t have extravagant or complicated cooking sessions.
* I keep things as simple as possible to help save me time so the things I eat daily are not complicated.
* I’m also not a picky eater at all and enjoy the taste of everything.

#1. An ~~apple~~ avocado a day keeps the doctor away

* I used to avoid avocados because of their high fat content, but now I often eat one avocado a day, usually as the first thing to break my fast (“breakfast”) and it’s shockingly filling. They are quite literally, the perfect low carb, keto-friendly food. They have very few net carbs, lots of fiber, and it’s mostly just fat. Not just any fat though, it has a magnificent fat profile of mostly monounsaturated fats. (This is the stuff olive oil has a lot of too.)

* I eat avocados with some...
 * [Salt & Pepper \(pictured here\)](http://i.imgur.com/Ewk66FF.jpg) or
 * Soy Sauce or
 * Lemon Pepper

**How to buy and rotate avocados so you always have some ripe ones:**

* I buy 6-8 avocados at a time because it takes several days for them to ripen and I like to have a good supply.
* An easy way to check if they’re ripe without having to smash the skin is to simply push down on the brown stem (if there is one). If it goes down, it’s ready.
* If too many avocados are ripening and you want to slow down the process, throw them in the fridge! As simple as that.
* With that trick in mind, I usually have 5-10 avocados in the fridge and 5-10 over the counter so that I have a constant supply.

**If you have too many avocados that have ripened, make guacamole! Guamacole is super easy to make!**

* Mash up all the ripe avocados together
* Add some lime
* Add some minced up cilantro and you’re good to go!
* If you’re at a (mexican) restaurant and they serve chips and guacamole, tell them you don’t want the chips, but order some chicken or steak with it and dip it into the guac! Delicious.

#2. Eggs

Normally I eat 2-3 eggs, a few times a week. They too, like avocados, are a very keto-friendly food. They have zero carbs and are highly nutritious with an excellent amino acid (protein) profile.

[Pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/VsZZOxX.jpg) are some fluffy hard boiled eggs with some salt and pepper. Simple and delicious. If I’m boiling eggs for the day, I will boil some extra ones at the same time to keep for egg salad (recipe below).

**Other keto friendly ways I prepare eggs?**

* Scrambled or sunny side up, fried with coconut oil.
* Omelette with cheese/veggies
* Poached eggs (w/ Hollandaise sauce) (Basically “eggs benedict” without the English muffins.)
* Egg salad (below!)

#3. Egg Salad

This makes for a nice lunch idea that’s easy to customize and takes barely a few minutes to make because you just mash the ingredients together.

* [Before (Just soft boiled eggs and avocado)](http://i.imgur.com/ujs445F.jpg)
* [After \(mash up eggs, avocado and mayonnaise\)](http://i.imgur.com/fOPn4Th.jpg)

**Recipe: Mash up all these ingredients together:**

* 1 Avocado
* 2 Soft-Boiled Eggs (hard boiled works too but soft is creamier)
* 1 tablespoon mayonnaise
* Optional: add garlic salt and pepper
* Optional: add some shredded Cheddar Cheese
* Optional: add cayenne to taste for spicyness

#4. Simply Delicious Vegetables

The following are common, non-starchy vegetables that I eat regularly:

* [Asparagus & Brussels Sprouts](http://i.imgur.com/xsMIkd6.jpg)
* [Broccoli & Cauliflower](http://i.imgur.com/kyR51l4.jpg)

**How do I prepare these guys? Easy! I bake them!**

Don’t be scared of ovens, people, it’s stupid-easy to bake things! Just follow the simple steps below:

* Preheat the oven to 400F.
* In a small bowl, mix a few tablespoons of **Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Soy Sauce together.**
* Optional: add some minced garlic, maybe some ginger depending on the veggies used.
* Put the veggies in a big bowl and pour this small bowl of oil and soy sauce into the veggies and mix it well.
* Put the veggies on a pan with Parchment Paper for 400F for 15 minutes.
* And that’s it! Ta-daaaa! See how easy it was?
* I personally like the EVOO and Soy Sauce, but you could also just put it all with BUTTER, too. That’s keto friendly, too. Oftentimes the veggies are actually there to act as a carrier for the butter.

#5. Blueberries! The Keto-Candy.

[Frozen blueberries are my favorite little snack!](http://i.imgur.com/GTbRzYg.jpg) I love the crunch they provide and since they’re so cold, I can’t eat a bunch of them because then I’ll get brain freeze. This also reminds me to treat berries like candy, so I eat them sparingly and usually NOT daily. When they’re on sale, I stock up on a bunch of them, wash them and keep them in the freezer. (I eat raspberries and strawberries sometimes too, but blueberries are my jam, without the jam.)

#6. Baked Fish

Fish is something I have ~3x a week that I’m always trying to eat more of. On the days that I don’t eat fish, I take a fish oil capsule to get more Omega 3’s in my diet.

* [This was a fillet of Alaskan Salmon surrounded by potatoes for the non-keto guests.](http://i.imgur.com/R686JDM.jpg) :)
* [I was at a friends and I suggested we bake some fish \(tilapia\), brussels sprouts and mushrooms and they didn’t even know we were eating a totally keto-friendly meal!](http://i.imgur.com/UmZV8cJ.jpg)

**Here’s how I bake fish (you could do this to fillets or whole fish):**

* Preheat the oven to 375F
* Rub salt, pepper, olive oil, lemon and blackened fish seasoning on both sides of the fish.
* Bake at 375F for 25-35 minutes.
* Done! How easy is that!

**Other fish choices:** I don’t eat tuna anymore because Wild Sardines in Olive Oil and Smoked Sprats are superior in every way. They are lower on the food chain than tuna and don’t accumulate toxins (such as mercury) and have a superior Omega 3 to 6 ratio! (Btw, I used to buy Riga Sprats but turns out they are stored in rapeseed oil, which is a terrible vegetable oil to eat, not only cause rape is bad, but it’s mostly bad fats… so no more of that brand!)

#7. Salmon and Cream Cheese (And Avocado!?)

* [In this photo I put salmon, cream cheese, avocado, green onions and some aleppo pepper on a big piece of lettuce to make a dank meal.](http://i.imgur.com/jH2zTVF.jpg) 
* Normally people eat the above ingredients sandwiched between a bagel. But you can’t have a bagel on a keto diet. Bagels are just bread. Fuck bread. Why would I want that stuff getting in the way of the deliciousness in the middle?

**Ingredients:**

* Smoked Salmon Lox
* Cream Cheese
* Salt and Pepper to taste
* Optional: Chopped Green Onions (Scallions)
* Optional: Capers
* Optional: Avocado
* Optional: If you want a “carrier”, you could put it all on a piece of lettuce.

#8. Cheese and Olives

I’ve been eating [this Kerrygold Dubliner Irish cheese](http://i.imgur.com/p4De4mo.jpg) as a standalone snack. I love to get a big knife and make extremely thin slices of these. The taste is so complex and satisfying. (They are available on Costco. And speaking of Kerrygold brand, by the way, their Irish butter tastes really good too. All their products come from grass-fed cows.)

I may or may not eat this cheese with some olives. Olives have almost no net carbs and have a great fat profile, so they are a great little keto-friendly snack. I love the ones in brine.

#9. Cream Cheese and Bastirma (seasoned, air-dried cured beef)

One of my favorite dairy things is to get [cream cheese and mix it with some Armenian cured deli meat called Bastirma.](http://i.imgur.com/PRGjonz.jpg) This is one of those foods that are not well known if you’re not familiar with the culture, but it’s highly spiced, the slices are extremely thin and delicious with some cream cheese.

**Here are some other Middle Eastern Foods that are keto friendly:**

Since my father is Lebanese-Armenian and my mother is Armenian-Armenian, I know about some foods that others may not know about that are very low carb and these are my random faves:

* [Lebni / Labneh \(Strained yogurt\)](http://i.imgur.com/CHfi64w.jpg)
 * This is a type of kefir cheese, made in a similar process as Greek Yogurt, but it tastes much more tart, like sour cream. Traditionally it’s spread on a plate and drizzled with olive oil and topped with some dried mint.  I personally think it’s dank as fuck.
* [Sujuk / Soujoukh / Yershik](http://i.imgur.com/kTZKT95.png)
 * This is type of highly spiced, dried beef sausage that you could find at your local international market as well, probably in the deli section. I love to eat them with cream cheese.

**Note:** One of the main drawbacks of deli meat, or highly processed meats is that their protein becomes inferior and a lot of important minerals (like potassium and magnesium) are lost as well, so I don’t make them my main source of protein.

#10. Nuts: Macadamia’s and Almonds

* As you know, when one is on a low carb diet, they should replace those calories with fat and nuts are predominantly high in fat. The top two nuts that are very low in carbs AND have a very healthy fat profile are macadamia’s and almonds!

* [Macadamia Nuts that are Dry Roasted with Sea Salt](http://i.imgur.com/BQSWxxn.jpg) are one of my favorite snacks. They taste like butter balls that are perfectly salted. (~20cals each)
* I *love* [these Wasabi & Soy Sauce Almonds.](http://i.imgur.com/5R4Huha.jpg) I always get a pound of these that last me the month.
* [These Marcona Almonds with Rosemary](http://i.imgur.com/fOgGA9G.jpg) are a bit pricey, but have an incredibly luxurious taste. Marcona almonds are fried in olive oil, by the way.

* **Warning for those trying to lose weight:** Nuts are high in calories and it’s easy to “accidentally” eat a few hundred calories of these if you are just munching mindlessly. Even if you practice severe carbohydrate restriction, eating more calories than you need can result in fat gain. (I still use MyFitnessPal when I want to ensure weight loss even on keto, but that's just me, YMMV)

You could have other nuts too, like cashews and peanuts for example. But as dank as they are, I can’t go to town on them cause they’re somewhat higher in net carbs, so I eat them very sparingly and infrequently. If I’m going to have peanuts, I usually opt for peanut butter, actually. And on occasion, I go for cashew butter. [\(relevant peanut butter related meme\)](http://i.imgur.com/GZO0Hfu.jpg)

#11. Milk Alternatives for when I want a creamy drink

**[Unsweetened flax, coconut, soy, hemp, cashew, almond milks.](http://i.imgur.com/FajoKSy.jpg) (We live in good times to have access to such variety!)**

* Note that ALL of these must specifically say **“UNSWEETENED”** on their label. The beauty of these are that they are only 30-45 calories per cup.

* **Coconut Milk:** In the summertime, there’s something so brisk and refreshing about coconut milk. (It reminds me of summer, probably thanks to all those dark tanning products that smelled like coconut oil.)
* **Hemp and Flax and Cashew milks:** I have only tried these a couple times, they are a bit more fatty, creamy, thick and I like them.
* **Almond milk** is my favorite. Some people don’t like it at all and that bewilders me, but… I like it and it’s a yummy drink to me. I sometimes will heat up a cup and drink it *hot.*
* **Soy Milk** is my go to when I’m looking for a more hearty drink (clocking in at 100cals/cup), I really like unsweetened soy milk. It’s also great to add to your tea so it’s like a chai-latte. Protip: If you live near some Asian stores, you can find unfiltered soy milk which tastes like the real thing. But you must make sure it’s not sweetened.

#12. Arugula Salad

[This is stupid easy to make.](http://i.imgur.com/GdU98Eg.jpg) I just added arugula and avocado and salt & pepper and olive oil. How easy is that? Really easy.  You could also do something similar with spinach. Loves me some spinach.

#13. Keto-Friendly Foods On The Go

If I’m on the go, I usually don’t have hunger and can get away with several hours without eating but… if I do...

* I like Quest Bars, specifically the Choc Chip Cookie Dough flavor. They are the only truly keto-friendly bars that I know of. (Edit: Costco carries Kirkland Protein Bars that are similar to these apparently and much cheaper!)
* Sunflower seeds (I love the cracked pepper version) found at most gas stations, are quite a good snack if you like spitting sunflower shells.
* If you’re not a fan of spitting sunflower shells, already-shelled-for-you roasted and salted sunflower seeds/kernels are also pretty delicious too. These also are found at gas stations. Just make sure they don’t have added sugar.

**I also take an avocado with me sometimes. Here’s how to eat a ripe avocado without any tools:**

* Bite the skin at the top to remove it and spit it out.
* Squeeze the avocado out from the bottom up. Eat it as it comes out the top hole.
* Eventually the seed will come out as well and you just keep squeezing it out into your mouth and into the trash or straight into the trash.
* **Fair warning:** Keep the avocado in a place that won’t get mashed in your bag by other things or else it will make a mess. Ask me how I know. :P (Maybe even put it in its own zip lock bag or something)

#14. Mineral Management and Daily Supplements

Mineral management is especially important on a ketogenic diet to prevent feeling fatigue (especially before strength or endurance training) or if you’re not feeling well while in ketosis. These are the following things I take:

* **Multivitamin:** I supplement with a daily one-a-day multivitamin to cover my bases.
* **Sodium & Potassium:** It’s no coincidence that many foods I eat are somewhat higher in sodium overall, and that’s because the kidneys excrete more than usual while in ketosis and so I make up for it with the higher sodium intake. But, to not get too much sodium, I use “LoSalt” instead of regular salt because it’s more potassium in it and half the sodium (salt) which makes for a better balance. I also drink bone broth almost daily.
* **Magnesium:** Two of [these magnesium pills a day](https://www.amazon.com/Doctors-Absorption-Magnesium-Elemental-240-Count/dp/B000BD0RT0/) (400mg) for 20 days will help stabilize magnesium levels. This improves almost every cellular process in your body (especially important for sleep and muscle cramps). This is doubly important on keto due to the kidneys excreting faster than usual.
* **Fish Oil:** If I did not eat fish that day, I’ll take 1-2 capsules of fish oil which has lots of omega 3’s in each capsule. 
 * **Advisory:** Many fish oil brands will say “1200mg” but really, only 300mg of it will only be Omega 3 fatty acids. So read the labels to make sure you're getting one with high DHA/EPA!
* **Protein:** If I haven’t ate much protein or I had a particularly hard strength training day, I will drink a scoop of [vegan protein powder](https://truenutrition.com/p-1169-vegan-protein-optimizer-formula-1lb.aspx) and add raw cacao and chia seeds in a blender bottle. The unflavored one tastes really blah but the chocolate or french vanilla flavored ones are a good powder that gets the job done with minimal fuss.

#15. Special mention for Fiber

If I’m feeling like I ate too many things that don’t have any fiber (read: meat, cheese, etc) and feel constipated, then I will have 1-2 teaspoons of organic psyllium husk mixed in water. It’s pure fiber which causes me to poop gloriously sometime later that day.

**ProTip:** Nowadays, if I’m going traveling or camping, I will take a zip lock bag of this stuff with me and my bowel movements won’t feel disrupted from the traveling and it works incredibly well. ([relevant meme](http://i.imgur.com/OAgPvtS.jpg))

Breakfast: 1 cup of organic rolled oats, 2Tbsp of ground flax seed, 3/4 cup of almond milk, a handful of strawberry slices, and a handful of blackberries.

Lunch: Salad (romaine, kale, spinach, red onion, baby tomatoes) with balsamic dressing.

> GI refers to how rapidly a food causes blood sugar to rise. High-GI foods, like white bread and potatoes, tend to spur a quick surge in blood sugar, while low-GI foods, such as lentils, soybeans, yogurt and many high-fiber grains, create a more gradual increase in blood sugar.

I just started the Keto diet about two weeks ago after realizing I gained a whopping 50 pounds during the pandemic! It really pissed me off and I just wanted to do something about it. So, I decided to go on a keto lifestyle change to help me shed off some pounds.

I've lost about 17 pounds within the first two weeks (I know that's mostly water weight), but I was just happy with the streak. But now I've been stuck at the same weight for the last 4 days (265lbs) and I just don't want to lose the motivation/streak I've been fueling on. I've been also very strict with keto and honestly don't ever feel hungry. I'm also really proud of myself since I feel like I've finally been able to have self-control and self-discipline.

Anyways, here's the break down for what I've been doing:

\- Maintaining under 20-25g net carbs (my macro calculator says I should aim for 35g)  
\- Max daily caloric intake 600-700 calories  
\- Workout 2-3x week (30m cardio and 1h of weight training)  
\- Mix-up of 16:6 and 20:4 intermittent fasting  
\- No cheat meals/days as of yet

I know there's always talk about starvation mode, but from my understanding, it typically occurs in people who are suffering severely emaciated and suffering from malnutrition. Although my caloric intake is quite low, I don't feel hungry at all and I attribute that to eating foods with more protein and healthy fats. So, I don't think that's the reason why I haven't been losing weight lately.

I'm wondering if anyone has dealt with something similar and can maybe offer some recommendations on how they were able to move past their plateau?",1

* Lara bar (I like the cherry one, organic raw ingredients, it is whole food, is not processed)
* Fruit, sometimes oranges, peaches, bananas, grapefruit, whatever I feel like having
* Dates (I keep a box of dates in the fridge at home and also at work, great boost of energy from fructose and extra calories)
* Pistachios (also keep a bag with me at all times, snack on as many as I want)
* Leftover dinner for lunch (usually pasta, sometimes quinoa and beans, or whatever else I made)

**Water**, I only drink water (not counting the smoothies or fresh juices I make with water, never any sugar) 

*Get home at about 330pm*

* Ezekiel bread and avocado, tomato, spinach, a pickle, homemade hummus (blend chickpeas/garbanzo beans with water and your favorite spices)
* Orange, carrot, water blended together

**Lots of water throughout the day...**

That's a typical day of eating for me. I also mix it up with salads and other greens, Asparagus, Brussel sprouts, etc...

I spend about $100 per week for myself and my girlfriend. Trader Joe's is my grocer of choice. It's not the cheapest possible, no, you can certainly eat less and be more frugal if you desire. But I really am not stressed about this, I eat healthy and enjoy the diversity and fresh ingredients that I buy. It's definitely cheaper per pound than meat or most unhealthy processed foods, premade meals, etc... Especially pre-made lunches, half of that is just rice, rice is cheap and easy to make with a rice cooker ($30 investment for a rice cooker), and usually they're loaded with salt and other processed ingredients anyways.

* Chia seeds
* hemp seeds
* flax seed
* pumpkin seeds
* sunflower seeds

**Nuts**

* walnuts
* pistachios
* almonds
* cashews
* raw organic almond butter (only ingredient is almonds)

* frozen strawberries
* frozen blueberries

* apples
* oranges

* carrots
* potatos (sweet and/or golden)
* broccoli
* cauliflower 
* sweet peppers
* cucumbers

* mushrooms

**pre-made snacks**

* Lara bars (they have whole food ones that are not processed, look at the ingredients, I like the cherry ones, they're inexpensive for $1 I get a lazy 200 calories and some extra protein and fructose)

That's about it. It's pretty boring and simple but that's what I like, other people may find it bland but so far everyone who tastes my cooking likes it. I cook a pasta and throw in whatever vegetables I haven't cooked yet.

I make homemade hummus blending chickpeas with water and garlic and cilantro or whatever I feel like experimenting with for flavor. I make sandwiches spreading hummus on the Ezekiel bread and adding vegetables like avocado and tomatoes. I dip vegetables in the hummus for flavor...

I try to eat as much as I want so nothing goes bad, once you get in a habit you'll find shopping easier and cooking easier. It just takes some effort at first.

It's also good to use my fitness pal to track at first to know you're doing ok with your calories and macros in general.

Hope this list helped you.

Let me know if you have any other requests or anything. I'm happy to help.

How I lost 196.3 Lbs in One Year,1878,gum1oh,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/gum1oh/how_i_lost_1963_lbs_in_one_year/,270,1591052102.0,"https://imgur.com/a/bUOfTNC

A year ago today, I started a journey to get my life on a better track. I had spent weeks researching various diets, exercises, and healthy living options. 

I had tried various diets before to moderate success, but nothing more than 60 lbs in a few months. I knew I needed real change. 

I decided to try strict keto, along with IF and OMAD. It’s beyond shocking how well and how quickly it worked. 

I set a goal of 200 lbs in a year. A nearly impossible goal, but I wanted something hard to make me motivated. 

I set a meal plan for myself, which has been the same meal every day. When I first wake up, I eat a cheeseburger with bacon and mayo, 6 scrambled eggs, and 8-10 bottles on Water with Mio sport. 

I also don’t eat on Saturdays/weekends depending on my mood. 

While I didn’t hit my goal of 200 lbs, I was damn close.  I was 365.9 lbs as of June 1st 2019. Today I am 169.6 lbs. I’m definitely disappointed that I couldn’t hit my goal, but very proud of what I accomplished. 

To anyone starting keto, having a hard time with keto, or considering doing it. You can do this. I didn’t do anything special, no pills, no crazy exercises, no surgeries. Just eating better, counting carbs, and keeping positive. 

One thing I did, to help cheating, was to just focus on today. Don’t cheat today. Don’t eat over your carbs today. Tomorrow is a different story, you can worry about that later. Just keep going today. 

I hope all of you are staying safe, and I wish you all the luck in the world.

How Many of You Are ACTUALLY in a State of Ketosis?,1,515u1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/515u1x/how_many_of_you_are_actually_in_a_state_of_ketosis/,42,1473049908.0,"Greetings,

I'm a practitioner of intermittent fasting, and I was wondering how many of you actually achieve a state of ketosis while practicing the ketogenic diet. The reason I ask is that I feel like the mechanisms of fat loss/lean mass gain during fasting and ketosis are similar. Both diets lower insulin levels to the point where your body begins to burn fat for energy. During intermittent fasting, you'll eventually break your fast, so your body will switch back to glucose while you're eating. 

Seems like the mechanisms are the same: lower your insulin levels and burn fat. You don't need to be releasing ketones in order to burn fat, all you need to do is run out of glucose, which happens during an extended (16 hours +) fast. 

Just curious as to how many of you are actually in ketosis, and whether or not you're seeing the benefits of being low-insulin without necessarily being in ketosis. 

[Here's an article about what I'm talking about.](https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/power-comparison-fasting-vs-low-carb-fasting-26/)

EDIT1: No need to down vote, I'm not being critical (and you shouldn't down vote even if I was). I'm simply of the mind that the thing about ketogenic diets that cause weight loss isn't necessarily the ketosis itself (because one can burn fat without being in ketosis), but is the increased insulin sensitivity.

EDIT 2: I'm really looking for someone who follows the keto diet less than strictly, and therefore doesn't enter ketosis but still has experienced weight loss.",1
How Should I Incorporate Carbs Back Into My Diet?,0,4z1ade,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/4z1ade/how_should_i_incorporate_carbs_back_into_my_diet/,12,1471911310.0,"I began Keto in mid May and have lost 30lbs. Went from 190 to 160. 145-150 is my goal weight. I'm a soon to be 43yr old female, 5'8"".
I began by keeping a strict record of everything I ate and sticking to my macros religiously. That lasted until end of June. Since then I've been doing very lazy Keto. I know what has carbs and what doesn't and I keep my portions small. Seems to be working well.

Once I hit my goal weight, I do plan on being a lot less strict on carbs. Right now I try to keep under 15g per day. I'm sure I go over from time to time though, but nothing too crazy.

Now when I say more carbs, I mean 40-50 a day possibly. Thats still much less than what I used to consume. It'd be nice to be able to eat all the broccoli, romaine lettuce, cauliflower I want and not worry about how many carbs I'm eating. Also, I wouldn't mind a piece of birthday cake on my birthday etc. I'm not going to go nuts with sugar or candy or anything, but it would be nice to be a little less restrictive. Is this possible?
I won't do it if it means I'm going to gain 10lbs back in a week of water weight or whatever. 
I just don't think 15g of carbs or less is sustainable for me for years to come. 

How should I incorporate  them back into my diet?",1

I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes for the second time (out of three pregnancies), and this time was so much worse than the last. I followed the low carb diet the dietician gave me to a T, walked after every meal, ran as much as I could stand even though ""running"" at 30 plus weeks pregnant is pretty laughable. I had to be put on injectable long acting insulin because my fasting bg was just too high. I felt hungry all the time. The insulin didn't even help that much. Awful. I never gained a pound, so this is not about weight. My BMI has always been normal. I test my fasting bg once a week (postprandial had always been normal post-pregnancy), and I noticed both my weight and fasting blood glucose going up, from normal to prediabetes. I wanted to go to a doctor for an A1c, but COVID and three kids and work made that challenging, so I started reading books. First I tried keto, even though I'd been a vegetarian, and I hated it and it spiked my fasting bg even worse. I finally read The End of Diabetes by Joel Fuhrman and decided to try it after the ADA diet, keto, Atkins. My fasting blood glucose after a month on wfpb is 102. Not quite normal (aiming for under 100 at least), down from a high of 130 (that was right after keto, oof). So, anecdotally, it works, and it works quickly, especially if you can do it before you're diagnosed.",0

Additionally, I find that I end up not feeling as satiated and end up overeating hence my weight gain (obviously this is partially an issue of willpower but I'm working on it). Does anyone have any suggestions for foods or recipes that are lower cal/carb and higher protein?",0
How do I keep things preserved as long as I can?,1,j83ixw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/j83ixw/how_do_i_keep_things_preserved_as_long_as_i_can/,0,1602293935.0,"I have basically three questions with other questions in them. If there's sites I'm missing that answers these, then knowing them would be appreciated. I don't know if posts like this are common, but I've tried searching and got as far as I could manage before resorting to asking here. I'm listing these in order of priority:

&#x200B;

1. (*Most Important Questions*) How should I store, clean, and pre-prep vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, and mushrooms? I know this depends on each individual item, and I've found three sites for advice so far. [StillTasty](https://www.stilltasty.com/articles/view/31), [Whfoods](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=faq&dbid=23), [Myplasticfreelife](https://myplasticfreelife.com/2010/05/how-to-store-produce-without-plastic/). I've also seen advice on reddit threads like [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/fofloi/store_your_veg_the_right_way_to_last_longer/), [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/7vpi3w/researchers_find_that_broccoli_should_chopped/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/cyj9qz/i_recently_learned_how_to_store_various_produce/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/gxc1cm/which_vegetables_are_healthiest_when_consumed_raw/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/91zhpj/what_is_the_best_way_keep_your_vegetables_from/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/bkpv4j/is_it_true_that_cooking_vegetables_removes/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/96abov/is_there_any_downside_to_prepping_your_veggies/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/42fvnt/cooked_food_vs_raw_food/), and kinda [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/gb6907/best_food_combination_ressources/). I need to know what's right, or any great way to boost longevity like how they store carrots in water and eat them 2 weeks later. Or like putting mustard powder on stuff like Broccoli to re-activate stuff. And what containers are best? What food scales are good?

&#x200B;

1. What state should I buy stuff in? I've heard vegetables that are flash-frozen are more fresh than ""fresh"" ones. Is that true for all vegetables and fruits? What about other stuff like legumes, whole grains, and edible mushrooms?

&#x200B;

1. (*Least Important, doesn't really matter to me rn*) And finally, what method of turning them into food (steaming, roasting, boiling, microwaving, etc.) is best for each kind, or is that just up to preference? (*More important*) What are the best sites or subreddits etc. to find recipes? I should mention that cheapness and getting the most bang-for-your-buck are important for me in this whole post.

&#x200B;

I know that *what really matters* (as I've seen repeatedly stated in thread after thread) is eating these things in the first place, so as long as I'm eating them the methods don't matter. And the difference in nutrients is negligible too. I get that. But honestly, I already hate everything I usually eat, and I know it's just a matter of my gut bacteria and I getting used to eating something different. And if I can't finish my meals, whatever, I'll naturally eat it as I get hungry. It's just a matter of finding a recipe I like in the end.

My *biggest priority* and question is making sure I delay things spoiling as much as I can.

Here's what I have right now: Tomato, Lettuce, Potato, Cucumber, Cauliflower, Beet, Carrot, Radish, Pulses (Dry Peas), Soy Beans, Lentils, and frozen Steamed Broccoli. That's Legumes, Cruciferous Vegetables and Leafy Greens. Don't think I have Whole Grains here yet.

Doesn't matter to me if my diet or anything like the percentage of nutrients retained isn't completely perfect right off the bat, or ever. It will *at least* be a whole lot better than what I had before, and it's a step in the right direction. Next step is using Cronometer with this, and using supplements if, well, I need to supplement anything. Also, if this isn't the best place to ask this, where's other places I can ask this?",0

>What Is Processed Food?  
>  
>""Processed food"" includes food that has been cooked, canned, frozen,  packaged or changed in nutritional composition with fortifying,  preserving or preparing in different ways. Any time we cook, bake or  prepare food, we're processing food.   
>  
>Processed food falls on a spectrum from minimally to heavily processed:   
>  
>  
>  
>Minimally processed foods — such as bagged spinach, cut  vegetables and roasted nuts — often are simply pre-prepped for  convenience.  
>  
>Foods processed at their peak to lock in nutritional quality and  freshness include canned tomatoes, frozen fruit and vegetables, and  canned tuna.  
>  
>Foods with ingredients added for flavor and texture (sweeteners,  spices, oils, colors and preservatives) include jarred pasta sauce,  salad dressing, yogurt and cake mixes.  
>  
>Ready-to-eat foods — such as crackers, granola and deli meat — are more heavily processed.  
>  
>The most heavily processed foods often are pre-made meals including frozen pizza and microwaveable dinners.

Frozen veggies are already processed foods, but I've read somewhere that's even better, because they don't go bad and keep a lot of nutrients. Those meat replacements look like they should belong in the last two categories, but don't know if they are that unhealthy.",0

How do you feel when others are eating their desserts?,0,4iv5go,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/4iv5go/how_do_you_feel_when_others_are_eating_their/,45,1463005611.0,"I went out for lunch with a friend yesterday and I enjoyed my cobb salad. At the end of the meal, she ordered some dessert. During this time, I had nothing to eat and so as we were talking, I ended up having to watch her enjoy something quite decadent. 

I know I can't change others and I need to go out and live my life, but I find it a bit frustrating. I know that if the situation were reversed, I wouldn't order dessert with a friend who is working on changing themselves for the better. I just wouldn't and I guess I wish other people were more like me. 

I just wanted to post this and see how you guys feel about these situations. Do you resent others? Does it bother you at all? I'm not tempted too much by sweets. I'm not going to say they don't look appealing, but once they're out of sight, they're out of mind. I think if I had something keto friendly to munch on or if I even had some tea, it would have made it easier, but I didn't want anymore food and I didn't bother ordering something else, because I knew I could handle it. I'm just a bit annoyed that my friend cared more about her indulgence than my feelings. Is that too harsh of an assessment? 

Edit: Ok so I guess my post came out pretty whiny. I don't expect anyone to change their WOE, just as I don't want them to expect me to change mine to suit their situation. To me, this is just a matter of compassion. If I was having lunch with an alcoholic, I would never order a drink, even if they'd want me to. Maybe I'm too sensitive, but that's just how I am. I think people who are very sensitive with their feelings and those of others aren't selfish pieces of shit...they're the type of people who comfort others and will do anything for their friends. Obviously not everyone is that accommodating and that's fine. Nobody is forced to coddle my feelings, but I am going to use this as a learning experience. Next time, I'll either not go out to eat with this friend or I'll order some decaf coffee.",1

""Those people were unhealthy from eating processed foods / factory farmed meat. There's nothing that shows that eating healthy, grass-fed, 'ethcially' raised (as if ethical slaughter could ever be a thing) lean meat contributes to heart disease or is unhealthy'.

How fast should I expect to lose weight on keto? Want to lose about 30 lbs,0,e4bjoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/e4bjoa/how_fast_should_i_expect_to_lose_weight_on_keto/,7,1575207545.0,"Some background info:

I’m a 20 year old guy, 5’6”, and ~179 lbs. From spring of my senior year of high school, to December of my freshman year of college (maybe ~8 months), I went down from 200 lbs to ~165 ish. I weighed 160-165 some mornings, it fluctuated. I lost nearly 40 lbs. I was on the low end of obese, according to my BMI, and I went down to only slightly in the overweight category, maybe a 25-point-something or a 26. I believe <25 is normal. All I did was, cut out unhealthy foods, went walking everyday. I drunk a LOT of sodas and stuff, like almost no water. Didn’t care for it. Cut all that out, went on a strict water diet for my drinks. Started counting calories at first, but I stopped after a few weeks. 

However, I’ve gained a little over the past year, around ~15 lbs-ish. Took some summer classes, and I ate a lot of fast food then, also towards the beginning of this semester. I think that’s where I gained most of it. Honestly, I thought I was still chubby when I was 165, (mainly because I still had some stomach fat left, I never got it flat) even though I had friends/family telling me I looked skinny, and great. 

Anyway, I’m looking back at pictures, and I’m thinking “man, I wasn’t even fat last year, how could I have thought that! I could have lost another 10 lbs, but not much.” 

So, I’m thinking about doing keto to get back down to my weight I was, around 165. If I can get down to THAT, then I want to get down to 150, see how I look. 

My question for all of you who have tried keto is (I know it varies), but how fast should I expect to lose weight? 

If I stick to the diet, how long might it take for me to lose the initial 15 lbs?",1

How many lbs of food should you eat daily??,2,bynqkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/bynqkm/how_many_lbs_of_food_should_you_eat_daily/,11,1560135829.0,"This is about those of us with large appetites that have trouble achieving satiation no matter what type of food we’re eating. Generally, I think our bodies simply recognize the volume of the food (lbs) and do not recognize calorie amount at all.
I don’t know if it’s true, but some websites claim humans usually feel satisfied after 3-5lbs of food **daily**. (Not per meal, but the total for the entire day.)

I’m using a standard large watermelon you can get from any grocery store as my volume test. According to the internet, one large watermelon is about 20lbs and 1300 calories??

I can eat 1/4 of the large watermelon without being uncomfortable. I can eat 1/2 and be painfully stuffed and about to burst. It’s the absolute limit of my stomach stretching for one sitting, but I can still eat several hours later.

1300cal/2 = 650cal  
1300/4 = 325cal  

20/2 = 10lbs of food  
20/4 = 5lbs of food  

So I can eat 10lbs of food painfully stuffed, but “satisfied” is 5lbs for one sitting? I don’t understand how the “normal limit” is 5lbs a day, but I can do it in one meal.

Another example would be potatoes. I can eat an entire 5lb bag of potatoes in one day, plus more. But it would have to be done in at least two separate meals, not one sitting.

What about you? How many lbs do you usually eat in one sitting? How many do you eat per day?",0

One reason is that I'm not a fan of (green) salads. I don't know, there's something about the stomach feel it gives me, it's just super uncomfortable. I do like baby spinach (which I also like to just throw on top of whatever I cook) but I'm also looking for something in addition to spinach because of the oxalates.

Other than salad, I tried steaming and I just end up with a sad soggy lump, all watery and bitter.

And then, just to top it off, I live in a small village, so the greens selection is fairly limited. All the recipe ingredients I see online (collards! mustard greens!) - I just can't buy those here. Even kale is only available in winter or frozen in a one pound block which isn't portionable. And as far as I can tell, most are only salad-able (as in: I don't think you're supposed to heat them? like Romana or lollo rossa?)

So I'm asking you guys for help: how can I get my greens in that's not salad or a sad soggy lump?

EDIT: Thanks everybody, so many great suggestions. I'm gonna summarize some solutions here, for future reference.

* Use in smoothies
* You can also count cruciferous veg
* Use lemon/acid to reduce bitterness
* Soggyness comes from overcooking, reduce cooking/steaming time
* Just throw tiny amounts into anything (like sandwiches, stews, etc)
* Don't forget about Nori
* Apparently it's great in oatmeal?! \^\^

I can eat any fruit (only blended), potatoes, corn, beans, grains, nuts, and that's it, plant wise. I know it's not healthy. I hate being this way and I'm in therapy.

1. Do not search the sub before asking your question. Because no one else will have ever asked about intermittent fasting and keto before. You discovered it!
1. Always remember to tell us about the color of your peesticks. They are absolutely approved medical devices sold in only the best pharmacies.
1. When posting, do not tell us your age or gender. That information is useless when talking about weight loss.
1. Before starting, please tell us about your plan to start tomorrow, or after the weekend, or after your birthday. Bonus points if you're posting to keep yourself accountable.
1. The most exciting thing you could tell us is about how Hardee's, Jimmy John's or McDonalds serve awesome, lettuce wrapped burgers. Who knew?!
1. Keto will turn you into a fat burning machine. When you post be sure to mention how many gallons of heavy whipping cream you put in your espresso, we're kind of keeping score. Bonus points for using coconut oil, you cheeky hipster.
1. This is so important I'll mention it twice, never read the FAQ. Seriously, who ever spends any time reading and learning new stuff? 
1. When asking a question, you get double bonus points if you give your post a title like ""hi, I got a keto question?"". It really helps us zoom in on the people asking questions, so we get a good idea of what their post is about before opening it.

How to stop life revolving around food?,2,f5w83u,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/f5w83u/how_to_stop_life_revolving_around_food/,71,1582079157.0,"I'm not 100% WFPB, but I get as close as I can.

It is exhausting. The other day I carried two thirds of my own body weight (yes, I measured it when I got home) in beans, veggies, potatoes, fruit and grains about 1km home from the store, and in a few days I'll have to do it again. My SO helps out by getting some dried beans/lentils/grains from the bulk store by his work (local store only does canned) but I have to send him reminders throughout the day to get him to go there while it's open. I've started hiding food to make the cupboards look empty and try to get him to go more often. Online delivery isn't an option because our intercom doesn't work (letting agent says it's the building's fault, building management says it's just our flat and we should talk to the agents) and deliveries usually end up going back to the depot. Plus I'm out all day at work and most evenings.

I need to eat two lunches to stay in normal BMI range and avoid being tired in the afternoon, which means making two lunches in a morning. Some days I also have two breakfasts (one before my daily run and one after) which means getting out of the door takes a long time. I also snack on a lot of food at work, it's kind of embarassing being the one who is constantly eating.

Recently I find myself eating out a lot (vegan but not WFPB) so I can get a break from cooking and from feeling overfull but also weirdly hungry. I frequently binge on dried fruit because I'm desperate for something sweet.

How do you keep it up? My phone is full of reminders to soak beans, cook beans, etc. I feel like I hardly have any brain left over for work and life.

I could exercise less, but I enjoy running more than pretty much anything else, so that sounds like a crap solution.

I tried to use an online blooding testing service to check iron, B12, etc, but wasn't able to produce enough blood. I've asked several GPs but they just give me leaflets on healthy lifestyle.

About a week into it now and every single day I lose at least half a pound.  I wasn't too excited when this first started happening as it was still within my 'fluctuation range' and I was prepared for it to bounce back up, but the last 3 days have been me entertain numbers I have not seen in years, with the steady trend still going downwards. for more than two years I have been at 135 to 140 with legit no exception. Today I hit 132. I was already impressed yesterday and the day before when i was at 133 and 134 respectively. It feels amazing cuz I don't feel like I've restricted myself food wise all that much. I found non-sugar substitutes for a lot of things that are low-carb without it, I get to eat chipotle like 3 times a week, and the keto cheesecake recipe is amazing. Even when I feel like I've binged too much, a quick look at my calorie counter says I've only had about 1200 calories.

Most of the initial weight gain is supposed to be water weight, and I'm just curious if there is a way to tell? I read in another thread that someone wasn't worried about it being water weight cuz they stay extremely hydrated, and I was wondering if that was true, like if drinking a lot naturally counteracts that or if you're body is still going to shed water it had stored?

I definitely look a bit leaner, but at 137 pounds for my starting weight, any weight i lose is going to look noticeable i imagine, i'm not exactly big to begin with.

 [https://imgur.com/gallery/Z7oL02N](https://imgur.com/gallery/Z7oL02N) 

TL;DR - sexiness isn't a number on a scale, it's a state of mind. The numbers on the scale can help or hurt that state of mind, but only you can ultimately decide if you feel sexy. 

&#x200B;

In 2017, my friends threw a ""purple"" themed cocktail party. I was planning on wearing a suit that was fitted for me in my senior year of high-school, when I weighed about 300lbs. When I realized this suit, which was massive by all standards, did not fit me anymore as I've gained even more weight since high-school, I was distraught. I didn't want to go to the party, I felt like garbage and frankly I hated myself for it. The next day I am sitting in the shower regretting the hangover and I come to the realization - I am not sexy right now, but I want to be sexy.

I start my weight loss journey that day, having already been subscribed to /r/keto after a short lived attempt to lose weight in 2016. I stayed subscribed because I loved seeing success stories, telling myself one day that could be me, if I wanted. I gave myself three rules to follow daily to aide in my ultimate goal of becoming sexy.

**RULES FOR BEING SEXY**

**1. Dress appropriately.** 

>Frankly this boils down to one thing - stop wearing sweatpants, ratty gym clothes, etc. in public. I wanted to cultivate a sense of personal style. Fashion isn't about denying yourself comfortable /loungy clothing, nor is it about only wearing uncomfortable yet fashionable clothing. Being fashionable is all about knowing what to wear and when.

**2. Get out of the house, everyday.**  

>Literally, just leave the house. At first it was small steps - going to the grocery store on a Sunday, grabbing my favorite low-carb meal on saturday (Chik Fil A grilled nuggets with a side salad, remove tomatoes). Eventually it evolved into a daily walk around a lake, meeting with friends for drinks, and generally being more social. 

**3. Love your body; if you don't love it, change it.** 

>Initially when I came up with these rules, this rule was ""lose weight,"" however I don't believe that's necessary. The way I practice this rule is silly but true - I flex at myself every day in the mirror. I'm so proud of how far I've come and I want to remind myself of that everyday.

Now, I could go into the details of my keto journey, what I did, etc. but realistically anyone that has lost this much has similar experiences to me. In summary - I did strict 30g carb limit for 10 months with 0 cheat days. 

I dropped A LOT of weight FAST. Scarily fast, in fact. When I was nearing 200lbs for the first time since I was 11 years old, I had an extremely scary moment of realization - I still hated how I looked and I couldn't envision a weight where I would feel differently. When I realized this, I immediately purchased my first pizza in 10 months and ate the whole thing in a night. After two weeks of what I was calling ""my keto break"", I could see and feel that I was up at least 10lbs. After some earnest and emotional discussion with my partner at the time, she helped me realized I was starting to look and feel like a skeleton. I was losing weight so quickly without any muscle to speak off and I looked gaunt. Yes - it's possible to weigh 200lbs and look gaunt.

Determined to not feel this way anymore, I started working out, but I knew something more would need to change. Around this time I visit Washington D.C. with my dad. We meet a friend of his who was a few years older than me and we immediately hit it off. He joined the marines straight out of high-school, got out after four years,  went to college and eventually commissioned as an officer in the Navy. I spend the next few days thinking about how much he's seen in his short life and I can't shake the feeling that I want nothing more than to be where he is when I'm his age. A few days after meeting him I tell my partner, and a few more days after that I've started the application process for Officer Candidate School. 

Now, at approximately \~230lbs and decreasing, my goal is definitively set. I need to be under 210lbs and be capable of completing a 13:45 1.5mile rune, 41 push-ups, and 50 sit-ups. Knowing the process of applying/being selected as an officer is long and hard, I start training confident I have enough time before I go to OCS. My first day of exercise I ran 1/4mile and walked the other 3/4 along with some light body weight exercises. In 12 months, my fitness milestones were as follows:

>10:15 1.5 mile rune  
>  
>1:47:30, 11 mile long run  
>  
>23:35min 5k  
>  
>Situps in 2 minutes: 75  
>  
>Push-ups in 2 minutes: 50  
>  
>Injuries: 2

Most importantly, after 13 months of putting on muscle and following my three rules as stated above, I have never felt so confident and strong in my life. A lot changed in these 13 months, I ended my long term relationship with my partner whom, understandably, didn't want to risk her career to be a military wife. I made new friends and strengthened existing relationships in ways I could have never imagined. I threw myself back into my passion for photography in a major way, having booked numerous gigs through sheer force of will and doggedness. Most importantly - I felt sexy, and that's really what we're all here for, right?

Finally for those of you curious - I eventually did go to Navy Officer Candidate School on October 13th, the birthday of the Navy. If you've seen the movie An Officer and a Gentleman - it's actually decently accurate, albeit dated. Needless to say it was pain all day everyday until graduation/commissioning. I've never been more challenged physically and mentally, so broken down, so completely removed from the outside world and I don't know if I would have been able to do it without the challenges and discipline required to lose nearly 30% of your body weight.",1

How “perfect” are you at WFPB - SOS free?,12,jdqdhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/jdqdhh/how_perfect_are_you_at_wfpb_sos_free/,17,1603091078.0,"About five years ago I lost 50 pounds of 110 lbs I need to lose using a WFPB SOS free diet. I wasn’t perfect, but I adhered to it close enough to lose the 50 and have kept it off for almost 5 years now.  Yay me. 

The problem is that my “good enough” WFPB diet hasn’t been good enough to tackle the other 60lbs I still need to lose.  I’ve just maintained at about 197 pounds. 

So I reluctantly see I can’t be making as many exceptions and just-this-once’s if i  want to get more weight off and keep it off.   I am reluctant to release the JOI nut milks, Raw Vegan Protein Powder from Garden of Life, cacao powder, and  Sabra hummus.  (The Shredded Wheat n Bran I like with blueberries I will sacrifice.) Those are pretty much the only foods I hold on to. 

My question to you all is how perfectly do you follow WFPB SOS free?  What exceptions do you make and how often?

I asked the attendant in the store if she could pull a shirt down off the wall for me. She asked me what size and I responded oh either large or xl. She told me here try this medium instead those will be way too big. I tried the medium and it FIT! I haven’t worn a medium top since high school!

Before and Afters (Big Guy in Boxers) - http://imgur.com/a/EvOiMnw

Picture from gym this morning - 
http://imgur.com/a/GkCMbJh

Somewhere around late September/early October of last year I was at my heaviest weight. 

My scale at home only read to 450 pounds. I used a shipping scale at work and I was pushing over 470 pounds at that time. 

I worked hard for a few months and had another round of decent success. Then Christmas hit and I let myself slide back until I finally woke back up around the end of January. 

On January 28th I started my routine back up for I would have to say the 100th time, already with the mindset of failing again in a few months. Same routine, same problems, same outcome. 

I've been stubbornly cycling off and on this way of eating for more than two years now, but I keep throwing myself into it full force and I could never keep the momentum. 

Something was different this time, the way it has flowed and developed has felt almost effortless at times. 

Felt scary after the past couple years of gritting my teeth and struggling. Almost felt like I was doing it wrong, but the pounds were still melting off. 

I beleive this may be because everytime I have failed or broken down, I retained something small. A good habit, an idea, information, etc. 

I'm sitting here today at 200 pounds down, still don't see if when I look at myself in the mirror.

I am still the fat kid in my eyes, but holy shit the pictures don't lie. 

This subreddit has given me constant motivation over the past two years. 

I'm hoping to be a small source of others inspirations.

I've made a few progress posts in the past, I'm hoping I only have one more to make in here and this part of my journey will be compete! 

My next goal is to make it to 230 pounds and begin total recomposition of my body. 

I have finished my second week of strength training and started my third this morning.

Thanks to everyone with the guts to share your stories and experiences for myself and others to use as vital sources of information and encouragement when we are down in our feelings and need a pick up.",1

The meal plan generation algorithm is based on information presented on nutritionfacts.org, which I believe to be the most trustworthy source of evidence based nutrition information. What it currently does is analyze a recipe’s ingredients (down to the gram) and combine recipes in such a way that every day of the meal plan satisfies (or nearly satisfies) [nutritionfact.org’s daily dozen](https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2018/03/metric.png) foods you should incorporate into your diet daily.

Today's update includes the most requested feature of all, ***calorie control***. you can now set a calorie range and each day of the plan will fall in that range.

This is an ongoing project that will be continually developed as new science becomes available. You can expect the introduction of further factors into the algorithm making the meal plans even healthier. It is intended to be a resource for all who care about applying the scientific evidence to live longer, healthier, happier lives. You can see what’s coming next on the [public trello](https://trello.com/b/UQkPED8a/the-scientific-meal-planner).

I am 40 years old. I am close to 500 lbs. I have an Autoimmune disorder. I started the Keto diet today. I am scared that I am going to die. Not sure if I can do this.

I FINALLY DID IT!!! 100lbs down!,3030,ac8kq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/ac8kq4/i_finally_did_it_100lbs_down/,134,1546569162.0,"Today I'm proud to say that I've hit a milestone that I've been craving more than any pizza or any brownie for the past seven months. I can't express how good it feels to be able to do simple tasks like tie my shoes without having to hold my breath and suck in my gut, and still probably fail. I DON'T EVEN SNORE ANYMORE! Everyday is like discovering my body anew, feeling all the bones and muscles that I forgot even existed. I've been too large for too long with no light at the end of the tunnel. Keto has changed my life for the better and in ways I never even dreamt possible. All the support I've had in these past seven months from friends and family, tagging me in keto videos, sending me keto recipes that they found, or even just taking my diet into consideration when we're out or cooking has been so touching and helpful.

I've posted progress pics on here before that has inspired people to either start keto, continue Keto, or just not give up. I didn't even think I might have that kind of an impact, but it does really feel nice to be helpful and give back to the community that has inspired me to keep strong and keto on. I hope I can do the same again with this post.

I still have 10lbs to go to reach my initial end goal, and 24lbs to go to reach my adjusted end goal, but that light that I couldn't see is now shining in my face like a phone with the brightness all the way up when you're in bed with the lights off. KCKO, brothers and sisters!

I Found The Cure For Plateaus!,4,1jfy0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1jfy0f/i_found_the_cure_for_plateaus/,8,1375328902.0,"I guarantee this will work.

A little background:  I've been in ketosis since January.  I maybe fell out twice -- once on my birthday and once during a cruise vacation.  I didn't really gain any weight with those lapses, and I was able to get back into ketosis easily after a day or two.

I lost 20 lbs pretty quickly in January/February, but I was stuck in the same three pound range for nearly 5 months.  I didn't mind all that much because my blood lipid numbers were improving, I wasn't dealing with acid reflux, and I wasn't heading down the road to metabolic syndrome.  Still, I wanted to lose another 20 and it wasn't happening.

Then, with absolutely no warning, my long term relationship ended.  I was (and still am) devasted.  I barely ate, but when I did I stuck with low carb.  Lo and behold, the stall broke.  I lost 5 lbs. in a week, and my weight is still dropping.

So there you have it.  Heartbreak is a surefire way to end a weight loss stall.

Although I don't recommend it.",1
I HAVE DEFEATED THE BEETUS!!,1679,gpdinz,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/gpdinz/i_have_defeated_the_beetus/,98,1590299814.0,"TL;DR - I got my mental health right, went on keto, and my A1C went from 13 to 5.1 in 3 1/2 months

I shared in my first post that the reason I decided to start my keto journey was because I got some bad news from my doctor and my GF begged me to not let myself die. 

In my heart, I already knew that I had Type II diabetes, but I was in denial. My feet weren't numb or swollen, I didn't have any wounds that weren't healing, and I didn't eat a lot of sweets. But I knew in my heart. 

So, when the doctor told me that my A1C was THIRTEEN and that I was probably going to die of a stroke before 40...I didn't care. I was mentally checked out. I made a joke about it to my GF, which is when she gave me the bitch slap back to reality. I have clinical depression and while the meds I was on kept me from doing anything drastic, I was basically a walking zombie and didn't care whether I lived or died. I wouldn't do anything because I know it would destroy both my GF and mother, but I was ambivalent to life. 

That day I made an appointment with a psychologist  and we added another med to the one I was taking and... it worked. I actually cared about life and actually wanted to get better. I had promised my GF that I would get healthy for her, but once the meds kicked in, I wanted to get healthy for ME. If I could ask for one thing that people take from my story, it's PLEASE take care of your mental health. It's already hard enough to fight to get physically healthy, and it's almost impossible to do so while also fighting against your mental health. 

Anyway, I had a follow up scheduled that was cancelled because of the whole rona thing, but when my doctor opened back, I made an appointment for yesterday. I was nervously optimistic, but I was trying to be realistic, so when I got the finger prick and was waiting, I told myself not to be too disappointed. (Side note: the doc was so blown away by my weight loss that he asked if I was on anything else besides keto). 

When I saw the doc's eyes beaming, I knew he had a huge smile under his mask. He said, ""Well, you can stop taking the Metformin now...your AC is 5.1!"" 

I was so stunned I probably had the dumbest expression on my face. I already knew my blood pressure was good, but I never expected to cure myself of diabetes so fast. He told me to kepp it up and I said I would.

So, yeah, when people talk about non-scale related goals, this was a HUGE one for me.",1

It’s weird, I thought I’d be more excited about it, but that hasn’t happened. What has happened is this...my blood pressure has gone from 135/85 to 116/70, I’ve lost a total of over 50 inches from my body, I’m a size 8, and I’ve trained myself to overcome my addiction to carbs. I will, like any person with an addiction, be conscious of this daily, & and will continue to live this way. At 60/61, it was finally time. I stopped tracking macros a month ago, &amp; have still managed to lose 2.8 lbs in that month. I was strict, never cheated, and didn’t talk about it much with anyone. Watching my husband have a heart attack 6 years ago should have opened my eyes immediately, but it didn’t. It took my own health scare to finally say enough to being obese. If I can do it, anyone can, it just takes a certain passion/determination for the good of your own self to accomplish it. Thanks to everyone on here😊",1

I almost kicked my waxer in the face.,1573,aftwdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/aftwdh/i_almost_kicked_my_waxer_in_the_face/,114,1547484283.0,"Right before I started keto, I'd just discovered I had pre-diabetes. Two months before that I'd lost topical sensation in my calves. My doctor thought this might be the start of diabetic neuropathy, but couldn't know for sure.

  


""If nothing else, I'd be quite certain the numbness is due to your health and diet,"" she said. I said that I was confused, that I'd been vegan for years, which was supposed to be healthy. How was I on a fast track to diabetes and all its horrifying complications? So I decided to switch from a low fat, high carb diet to a ketogenic one. 

  


A month after going keto, my blood sugar was testing normal every morning. After four months, I'd completely reversed my pre-diabetes. I was amazed. However, my calves were still numb. I figured that the damage was probably permanent, and told myself that I was lucky it was only the inability to feel things touching my calves; it could have been a lot worse. My doctor took a ""wait and see"" stance, but I wasn't even hopeful about it, and I nearly forgot about it.

  


So, now it's over a year in. I get waxing done for my hair removal needs, and have for a little while now. I hadn't been in for about six weeks, so when I got there my waxer and I were chatting quite a bit. I knew the drill, we were both having a good time talking, and I wasn't really paying attention.

  


Now, to be clear, when hot wax goes on your skin it's...well. Hot. I'm used that sensation everywhere but my legs, so when she went to start on those, I wasn't expecting to feel anything at all. She was in the middle of a sentence when she started applying wax to my left calf. And unfortunately she got interrupted...by me. By a shriek that could have broken a window, and my leg jerking up so quickly I worried I had kicked her in the face.

  


...because I \*felt\* it!!!!

  


After the initial ""are you okay?!""s and ""WTF was that?"", I reached down and started rubbing my fingers over the skin on my legs...and I could feel that, too! I even smacked them a couple of times as though they weren't real. I hadn't felt anything in my calves for so long that they almost felt forgotten. It was like getting a piece of myself back.

  


No waxers were harmed in the making of this post, thankfully. I didn't kick her like I feared, she's totally fine, and the worst of it long term is just going to be my embarrassment. I also tipped a bit extra as compensation for almost giving that dear woman a heart attack.

  


I have a long way to go until I reach my ultimate wellness goals, but this was an incredible reminder that I'm on the right track. I could recite a mile-long list of things that have improved since I went keto, but this one hit me the hardest for some reason. I'm so thankful I could cry. 

  


To all the keto newbies/New Year's Resolutioners, I really hope to be reading your success stories in the near future! Because you \*will\* have success stories. And to all the veterans, thank you for being so awesome in this community - without you I probably wouldn't have gotten to this point.

  


Happy, Happy New Year, everyone!


Edit: Holy moly. I've never had a post ""blow up"" before; this was a really unexpected. Since this is on the front page right now, I want to answer a couple of questions and clarify something.

I was vegetarian/vegan for almost five years (strict vegan for three). I went keto in December of 2017, and the first thing I incorporated was a whey-based protein powder. By the end of the week I was eating meat again. The first few days I was literally crying on and off through the day. I was terrified that adding fat the way I was would give me a heart attack on the spot. I hated myself for hurting animals again just because I was ""selfish"". The idea of eating the amount of protein my health professionals were suggesting seemed overwhelming.

I don't feel that way anymore. I spent a lot of time beating myself up with every choice I made in my diet, and I've moved beyond that. I'm happier that way. I don't eat a whole lot of dairy, so I do eat meat for the majority of my protein. The rest of my diet is filled with a lot of low-carb vegetables and fats. I'm not anti-vegan. For the people it works for (including the vegan keto community), rock on - I'm glad it does. It just didn't work for me. And trust me, I spent years trying.

Finally, my doctor had been giving her best guess, but admitted herself she didn't know the exact cause of the numbness. I'm sure she would have looked into it more if I hadn't turned my diet around so quickly. I'm still not home, but I'll definitely look for a test of my B12 levels like some have suggested (though I did try to supplement that when I was vegan).

Thank you so much for all the supportive and awesome comments. Y'all are great. ",1

Most people who were at the dinners hadn’t seen me in years and didn’t know I lost 110lb from 2018 to 2019.  So they were a little shocked.  She asked how because she and her husband have been unsuccessful.

She immediately told me I was going to die from liver failure.  I couldn’t help but let out an immediate laugh and then catch myself (thanks bourbon).  She told me she sees young people go into liver failure and die from keto all the time her hospital.   

She really didn’t like when I told her my doctor has been taking advanced labs every time I see him and is scratching his head.  All measurements have improved.  Everything related to heart, liver and kidneys.  She said the lab must be wrong.  I just smiled and said “The proof is not in the pudding. Pudding is what the labs say was killing me.”

The great thing Is I decided to finally post this because I'm in love with my progress and I'm so happy to finally be doing something sustainable that works.

I'm also doing the laziest of lazy keto so please don't be discouraged to start if you don't think you can stick to being strict.

This is the first ever shirtless picture that will be on the internet of me. I've never in my life been shirtless in public, I've always gone swimming with my shirt on etc and I've always been super self conscious of my man boobs, but they are almost gone now :). I definitely have a bit to go maybe another 20kgs but holy crap this comparison blew me away. I'm going to introduce much more exercise soon mainly concentrating on body weight training with push ups/squats/planks etc to build strength and muscle.

Keto is a magical magical thing.


Edit: holy wow you guys.  I'm absolutely blown away at the response..  Thank you all so much for your kind words and I'm happy to be an inspiration to the man boob community. 

A few people are asking about what I eat and fast and what not. I mainly end up doing 16:8 fasting..  Sometimes if ends up being 18:6.. I just don't eat breakfast then have lunch when my lunch break is at work.  Occasionally I have a late night cheeky snack of cheese cubes with tomato sauce so it's not always a strict fast. 

Lunch: salad and meat.. Subway salad if I'm lazy and I'll add some grilled chicken tenders from oportos. Sometimes Ill get a meat pack from the grocery store and cook that, chuck it in a bowl with sour cream and a bunch of shredded cheese.  Sometimes I opt for a bunless burger and a couple of nuggets (I still enjoy nuggets on this woe.  Most places 3 nugs are about 7g carbs) 

Dinner: we have a wide range but our lazy go to meals are fathead pizza..  Sliced chicken lasagna...  Whey protein fried chicken with some veggies..  Chicken schnitzel made with a number of different crumbs. Occasionally we will just go to McDonald's and get triple cheeseburgers or KFC and get a couple of original fillets even though that's higher in carbs about 7g each fillet.  

I really just eat what I want now but still in a keto sense..  Because I know quite well now the carb count for most every day foods I do a rough estimate..  We do try to stay away from processed stuff but it's not always the way we end up..  By super lazy I just mean the only thing we pay attention to is the carb count and even that often goes over 20g a day.  ",1

I had my doubts about certain sugar replacements, but even they have made it so I can enjoy treats without my just entering that never ending cycle of hungry binging.

I was having days where I eat around 3000 calories before this, but if I stick to low carb I just don't have that urge. Yesterday I felt I was 'pushing it' to have a low carb quesadilla to finish off my day, but I was only at 1210 calories when i added it.

Most of what I like I can still eat its just about either replacing flour or sugar. Even with the sweets what is amazing is you get that tate but you just don't crave more. Like I can have one peanutbutter cup and the rest of the day I don't want one.  Even with the keto cheesecake, 1 serving is almost too much.

The only thing I really miss is being able to have sushi, I used to eat it every other day, but the rice is just too many calories. I tried to eat poke as I can just get the raw fish with some green onion or what have you, but it really just wasn't the same. I've been making due with just eating a salmona or tilapia every day. Kind of miss noodles too, but as long as I'm careful with sauces I can still keep under my carb limit and eat it just with the meat.

Even if I don't lose much weight or even after I do,  I imagine I'd want to at least stick with a low carb diet if not full keto.  Not saying I would deny my self eating out here and there, but who needs all that sugar? I know Erythritol is a bit controversial here, but I've had zero digestive issues when using monk fruit sweetener. Even a low-carb bagel like experience seems possible with the 'everything but the bagel' seasoning on a 4 net carb tortilla. No matter what your goals are, that just seems more sensible than 48 carbs from a real bagel.",1
I am starting a PhD in Medical Devices. What device or diagnostic system would best support the field of Preventative Medicine?,3,c6urow,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/c6urow/i_am_starting_a_phd_in_medical_devices_what/,9,1561813321.0,"Hello All, 

I am soon starting a PhD program in Electrical Engineering, Medical Devices and Systems at UC San Diego. Among the reasons I picked that university (other than their top-notch engineering program) is that I will have access to their medical campus, UCSD Health, as well. 

Plenty of research already exists on implantable blood glucose monitors. Indeed, I know of at least one company trying to produce them right now and has even gotten FDA approval. 

I was thinking a more portable, wireless version of the [Holter Monitor](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/holter-monitor/about/pac-20385039) would increase the ease in which physicians can monitor the heart health of their patients. Perhaps a version that allows one to be monitored even longer, and perhaps allow long term studies of people's hearts as independent lifestyle variables are varied (i.e. particularly diet, but exercise as well). Maybe in the future, this device could be small enough such that it could be a mainstream consumer product that allows people and doctors to monitor their heart via their smart phone. 

Similarly, a fully implantable, more affordable, tiny [loop recorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/implantable-loop-recorder/pyc-20384986) could make it much easier to monitor patients. If the device could be made small enough, it might be able to be injected under the skin without surgery or anesthetic, further lowering its cost and increasing its applicability. 

Many of you practice your diet because you or a loved one were at risk of a chronic disease. If you went to your doctor, and she or he said ""there is this new easy to use device  that will help us monitor your health,"" what would that device do?",0

I've been transitioning into a plant-based diet.

Like many people, I only allowed myself seafood, dairy, and eggs. Little by little I saw the improvements in my energy levels, motivation, etc, so I was really excited and happy that I was able to stick with it and do it.

Today, I still wanted to stick with it. I decided to make mac and cheese with potatoes and carrots. Because I didn't have any protein source, I thought of adding canned black beans. (WORST IDEA EVER!!!!!!)

Basically, the canned beans injected their own lack of flavor into the mix and I ended up with a very flavorless mac and cheese with flavorless, soup-y beans. My mom had offered some of the chicken nuggets she was baking; but I was stubborn in that I was going to get my protein through the beans.

Because the Mac and cheese wasn't really palatable, (I tried resolving this with nutritional yeast, cheese, salt, and it was just not inspiring), I accepted my mom's offer and munched on some baked chicken nuggets dipped in the cheese sauce I made.

I ate them quickly. When I was done, it sort of clicked in my brain, and I felt sad. I felt like what I'd just done didn't match to the goal and vision I had in my mind. It was such a mishap, a failure to what I had wanted for myself. I felt bad.

Right now, I feel more relaxed, I guess? Because I know that my goal doesn't have to stop because of a mistake. If anything, I NEVER want to feel that way again.

CW: \~195 (but I had my scale confiscated a few days ago, so not entirely sure)

I've been holding onto a single pair of jeans that I bought when I was 14 years old, nearly 20 years ago. I don't know why, they really aren't anything special and they're not even a style I tend to wear now. Over the years the only purpose they've ever served is to pull them out occasionally and be shocked I could ever fit them. I didn't honestly believe I'd ever be able to get them on again.

This morning I knew there was no way they'd fit, but figured I'd just see how far up my hips I could get them. I pulled them all of the way up. I thought that was odd. As I made my way over to the mirror, I buttoned them up. Then I zipped them. Then as I stood in front of the mirror I looked down, then back at my reflection, then I gasped and said out loud in complete shock ""... I did it.""

And then I bawled. And I may be tearing up as I write this. I didn't know I could do it, guys. But today I buttoned them up.

It used to feel cheesy to say, but keto has changed my life.

I did dive right into meat, I just went from vegan keto to vegetarian to adding fish and now I straight up eat meat and never going back.

If you’re thinking of starting keto...hopefully I can help convince you that it works. It worked for me, and in all honesty if I can do it then you most definitely can do it as well because I’m just a normal person who used to love carbs until I realized carbs do not love me back.

Now on the real, my body is not ‘perfect’ and there is still a big part of me that feels like I shouldn’t be posting a picture in a bikini. I’ve always been overweight and it’s really hard to get to a point where I don’t feel like I am and am always going to be the ‘fat girl.’

Ive started to realize now though that perfect is a myth though and this has helped me go from hating my body to finally giving it the love and acceptance it deserves. Jiggly parts and all!

Keto has changed my life in so many ways that I never expected and it can change yours too. It’s not going to always be easy but it will be 1000 % worth it.

Bikini pics 👙 on r/keto are optional, but highly recommended if you’re looking for a liberating but some what terrifying experience.

P.S I’m off to the Philippines tomorrow. Please wish me luck in avoiding carbs. If anyone has any keto friendly local food recommendations send them my way.

As the title says, I bought a tube top. Me? Wearing a tube top? Never in my life would I have considered wearing something so revealing. That showed all my insecurities. I  just figured it was time to try something new. I reluctantly got a medium. When I got home to try it on, I held it up and thought there was no way I could fit in it. But I tried it anyway. It fit. Not only did it fit, but I LIKED how I looked in it! I just couldn’t help but breakdown in tears. A year of discipline, ups and downs..I FIT IN A MEDIUM. It might sound silly to others but I know you guys just get it. 

On the before picture It was April 2018, And I met Jeffrey Dean Morgan at Walker Stalker! I was SO excited and so happy. At that point I had lost 40lbs (started at 263) and felt great. Until I looked at the picture. I was embarrassed. I made progress but still so ashamed of how I just let myself get that big. I met one of the coolest, nicest people but I couldn’t get over my size. So I just put it away. 
 
Until today! 

I’m currently 147lbs and the happiest I’ve been, ever. the first day I even actually showed anyone (you guys haha) the full picture! I met Negan guys! I’m not prediabetic. My sugar is perfect. My cholesterol is perfect. My son has his mom in the best ways possible now.

Not great.

So fast forward a year, and thanks to a whole food paleo meal plan and lots of exercise, I dropped about 80 lbs. That's where I stalled out for about 6 months, ultimately gaining back about 20 pounds until (cue the music) I keto'd the eff up.

Today I'm at a place where I thought I'd never be. A year ago I had just accepted the fact that I was just going to be fat forever. I had been diagnosed with ADHD and Binge Eating Disorder a year prior and wasn't liking the idea of being medicated for it. I joined a burlesque troupe to learn body acceptance (wonderful experience!), and fell in love with someone who didn't care how my body looked. 


Then, I realized that I wasn't going to live long. I knew I wanted a family, but what's the point in that if I wouldn't be able to enjoy things with my kids due to my weight? What would be the point if they had to take care of me due to health problems from being overweight? I also knew I didn't want my partner to have that burden either. I think my main turning point was in Las Vegas when the ride operator at the Stratosphere told me that I had to get off the ride because the seat belt would not buckle due to my large thighs, and getting on those rides were always my dream. 


After that incident I decided I had to do something, I began scrolling through r/loseit and decided I'd do the classic CICO method, but that didn't really help with my binge eating problem being that carbs was the main thing I binged on and I was still eating them. I always saw this subreddit out of the corner of my eye and always said it was way too hard and wasn't even going to try (plus I was vegetarian at the time). Then I watched That Sugar Film and realized that I'd never get over binge eating on carbs if I didn't stop eating them and get rid of that craving, and I did. And I actually decided to click on this subreddit and absorb all of the wonderful support from you guys. I also got medicated for my ADHD which has also helped my binge eating a lot! 


As of now I've lost 75lbs, my binge eating is almost a rare thing and when I do its usually with ketogenic junk food. Hopefully one day I'll have the time to get back to Vegas and ride the rides on the Stratosphere too!

Look I never claimed that we are super skinny models now because we 100% aren't I'm still not happy with my body and I've got some more to lose, probably 10-15 kgs more I'm still reasonably big but no where near what I used to be. My gf still wants to lose weight as well so our journey continues. Yes the after picture is a great angle and it capturing all the right things, literally every single person that takes a picture of themselves does this, its still us... that's still what we look like... its not fake. Also people saying my hair colour changed need to find out what sun light is... so to address the ""show us your body"" and ""but the hair"" here is another recent selfie [https://imgur.com/a/8o6kex4](https://imgur.com/a/8o6kex4) I thought I'd do another comparison though just to show how far I've come with my body as well as my face.

When i started on this path two years ago, i was on death's door, at over 52 BMI, 330+lb. Thanks to this community, Keto and IF, I made something that i honestly thought i would need magic wishes to achieve, happen!! Never in my wildest dreams did i think i could EVER lose 139lb, its like living in a dream. I have a goal set for maintence at 180, and hot damn, i believe i can see that too.  Knowing that i have given my daughter her father back, is such a priceless feeling.

Don't give up people.. i stalled for 3 months, then my body got going again. If you want it, believe it to be possible.  These are really dark times, but positivity WILL see you through to the end.

I cannot get enough of my progress pics!,1732,aj0thd,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/aj0thd/i_cannot_get_enough_of_my_progress_pics/,116,1548286265.0,"Hey Ketoers!

Similar to another recent post on here, I had gotten so heavy (from complete lack of exercise, too much junk food, and way too much beer and wine) that whenever I saw a photo of myself, part of me died inside. I tried to justify it for a long time (“I don’t look so bad…” “other people don’t notice…” “it’s just a bad photo…” etc.), but the truth was, I felt very uncomfortable in my own skin and hated the way I looked and felt in clothes. I had gotten up to a size 16 (after being a size 4 about 10 years ago), and knew it was time to make a change. I am the maid of honor in my sister’s wedding later this year, and I know that there will be a million photos of me taken and I don’t want to look like shit in all the photos.

A facebook friend had posted about losing weight, so I decided to reach out to her to ask her how. She told me Keto. I had heard of it, but never really knew much about it. So I started that day. I did lots of research and learned what I could and couldn’t eat, and the weight just started falling off. I cut out ALL beer and wine (if I want to drink – never during the week anymore – I’ll have vodka/soda water), and started limiting my carbs and doing cardio several times a week. Nothing crazy at first – 30 minutes on my elliptical and light jogs, and the weight fell off. I also weigh and measure pretty much every piece of food that goes into my body.

The first month, I lost a little over 12 pounds. Same with month two. It has slowed down now, 104 days in, to about 6-7 pounds in the last month. Sometimes it can be discouraging since I’m being so strict about my macros and not necessarily losing weight every week, but every time I get discouraged, I look at my weight tracker on my FitBit and see that the weight is coming off, slowly but surely. I’m down 2 pounds since January 10th. It’s not as fast as I’d like, but it’s happening. It’s important to be persistent and keep going, because little by little, that weight comes off! And some days, I’ll step on the scale and be 2 pounds lighter than earlier in the week.

Despite me losing weight slower than I’d like in an ideal world, SOO many people have been commenting on my weight loss and telling me how awesome I look. And you know what? I FEEL awesome.  I went from not being able to jog around the block to running 4 miles without stopping this past weekend. All of my ski pants fit again. I’m able to zip up knee-high boots that were previously too tight on my calves. I’ve had to buy tons of new clothes and I’m down to a size 10/12 and Medium shirt (from XL). When I put my hands on my hips/waist, I can literally feel a difference and know I’m thinner. It just makes me want to keep going!

And looking at before and after progress pics certainly helps! I just look at this photo and can’t help but think how much better my arms look! And waist! And everything! I feel so much damn better!

I cant eat veggies. I wish I could. My senses just recoil at the taste and smell.

I am 26.  I have never been able to eat vegetables in my life.  I hate hearing ""oh youre just a picky eater get over it"".  Imagine I gave you a 8oz glass of spoiled curdled milk and said here, drink this every meal for the next 6 months.  Are you ever going to get used to that?  Thats the best analogy I can think of for what specifically broccoli, asparagus, kale, cauliflower, artichoke, green beans, peas, etc, taste like to me.  My eyes water, and my gag reflex triggers, basically all my senses are overwhelmed, and they tell me not to eat whatever I just put in my mouth.  This reaction only happens with bitter things.  For example I cant drink coffee either because its the same reaction.  I wish I could eat veggies plain, I really do.  The health benefits are enormous.  

So, I am asking for help from other people who have the same taste/smell aversion to veggies that I do, how do you deal with it?  Do you have any specific recipes to share?  Do you just not eat veggies?  There must be something I can do to choke these little bastards down.",1
I celebrated my 4 month ketoversary in ER with a kidney stone...so why am I happy about it?,1555,dgfhrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/dgfhrx/i_celebrated_my_4_month_ketoversary_in_er_with_a/,106,1570830788.0,"This past Friday I was awoken early by pain. I knew immediately what it was as I have had several kidney stone bouts in the past. Typically the pain lasts for about 4 hours for me, but at the 10 hour mark I tapped out and went to ER just in case this was more serious. They loaded me up with glorious pain meds and let me know I was passing a 3mm stone. I finally passed it on Sunday morning. Sweet relief!

So...why am I happy? First off, Keto didn't cause my kidney stone - I've been having them since I was 18.

My last bout was 4 years ago. When I had that kidney stone 4 years ago the doc showed me my CT scan which showed my kidneys were FULL of stones. I was doomed to suffer.

&#x200B;

Since I've been on Keto I've learned all about electrolyte balance and how this can help clear up the kidneys and prevent stones. So I asked my doc what this CT scan showed. He said other than the current stone I was passing he saw two small slivers and other than that I was completely clean. I ended up passing the stone and the two slivers. I was able to completely dissolve and clean out all my kidney stone issues! Apparently this stone was the last ""FU"" of my kidney stone issues on the way out the door.

Also of note, at the hospital my blood pressure was 127/80. I haven't taken my blood pressure at all since doing Keto. to have normal blood pressure in a stressful environment? UNBELIEVABLE!",1

It was not pretty, but I wanted to make sure that I get into ketosis as fast as possible.

&nbsp;

Sometimes, I just want to make my life a little easier and not get overwhelmed by inputting carbs into [myfitnesspal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/).

&nbsp;

Don't you worry, I created a comprehensive no/very low carb food list that you can use whenever you don't feel like counting carbs.

&nbsp;

Do no carb foods exist in their natural form? Just take a look at food labels for cheese or meat. Most of them say that they have zero carbs in them. It is not really true, though. 

&nbsp;

Companies usually do this when carbs in ketogenic foods are negligible, which is less than 1 grams per serving.

&nbsp;

It is probably shocking to you. I was shocked too!

&nbsp;

Don't be discouraged, I am here to walk you through the no/very low carb food list and reveal the usual pitfalls that food companies don't tell you. 

&nbsp;

# No carb meats

I try to buy my meats in the farmer's market, to make sure they are unprocessed and truly have no carbs. Processed meats have various chemical compounds that are not naturally present in fresh meat. These chemicals could be [detrimental](https://authoritynutrition.com/why-processed-meat-is-bad) to your health. I want to point out that not all processed meats are bad for you. A lot of them are just cured with spices and salt without chemicals. Just watch out for the additional carbs!

&nbsp;

**Here is a list of processed meats:**

* Hot dogs
* Salami
* Sausages
* Bacon
* Ham
* Salted and cured meat (corned beef)
* Smoked meat
* Dried meat (beef jerky)
* Canned meat
* Ham

&nbsp;

**Here is a list of popular, unprocessed no carb meats:**

* Beef
* Pork
* Veal
* Chicken
* Lamb
* Turkey
* Duck
* Quail
* Hen
* Most organ meat from animals (livers could have carbs)
* Elk
* Caribou
* Ostrich
* Venison
* Bison
* Emu
* Rabbit

&nbsp;

# No carb seafood

When it comes to seafood, you should understand that some seafood naturally contains carbs. I personally thought that all seafood would be a no carb food category.

&nbsp;

**Here is a list of seafood that has some net carbs:**

* Clams    **(2.39g per 100g)**
* Lobster  **(1.27g per 100g)**
* Mussels  **(3.44g per 100g)**
* Octopus  **(2.07g per 100g)**
* Oysters  **(3.73g per 100g)**
* Scallops **(2.41 per 100g)** 
* Shrimp   **(1g per 100g)**
* Squid    **(2.92g per 100g)**

&nbsp;

**Here is a list of unprocessed no carb seafood:**

* Crab
* Tuna
* Salmon
* Tilapia
* Cod
* Catfish
* Pollock
* Spanish Mackerel
* Flatfish
* Haddock
* Grouper

&nbsp;

# Almost no carb vegetables and fruit

There are no vegetables and fruit that have zero carbs. I go into much more details about it in this guide to [ketogenic vegetables](http://www.ketogeniclab.com/ketogenic-vegetables/).

&nbsp;

**Here is a list of ketogenic vegetables and fruit with almost zero net carbs per cup:**

* Asparagus (2.4g)
* Avocado (2g)
* Bok Choy  (0.8g)
* Cabbage   (1.5g)
* Celery    (1.4g)
* Coconut   (5g)
* Eggplant  (1.87g)
* Endive    (0.1g)
* Escarole  (0.1g)
* Lettuce   (0.54g)
* Mushrooms (1.6g)
* Radish    (2.04g)
* Raspberries (3.7g)
* Spinach (0.39g)
* Water spinach (0.6g)

&nbsp;

# No carb alcohol and beverages

When I started doing a ketogenic diet, I had to give up beer. It wasn't the best day of my life. Fortunately, you can still enjoy alcohol while being on a ketogenic diet. 

&nbsp;

**Here is a no carb food list for alcohol and beverages that I drink regularly. No flavored spirits. They might have sugar!**

* Bourbon
* Brandy
* Cognac
* Diet Sodas ( watch out for sweeteners )
* Gin
* Rum
* Scotch
* Seltzer water
* Soda water
* Sugar-free and carb-free energy drinks
* Tequila
* Vodka
* Whiskey
 
# Almost no carb Condiments and Seasoning

I love cooking on a ketogenic diet. It is easy, and it makes you think of new recipes all the time. The right seasoning and condiments can make any food tastes wonderful. 

&nbsp;

**Low / no carb food list seasoning (1 tsp net carbs)**

* Salt (0g)
* Black Pepper (0.9g)
* Chili Powder (0.4g)
* Curry Powder (0.5g)
* Mustard (0.1g)
* Most Hot Sauces (0.2g)
* Dill (0.8g)
* Basil (0g)
* Chives (0g)
* Cinnamon (0.7g)
* Oregano (0.4g)
* Rosemary (0g)
* Thyme (0.1g)

&nbsp;

**Almost no carb dressings per (1 tbsp net carbs):**

* Soy Sauce (0.5g)
* Mayonnaise (0.1 g)
* Caesar Dressing (0.46g)
* Ranch Dressing (0.9g)
* Italian Dressing (0.94g)
* Bacon and Tomato Dressing (0.3g)
* Peppercorn Dressing (0.47g)
* Vinegar (0.05g)
* Sweet and Sour Dressing (0.59g)

&nbsp;

# No carb oils and fats

Ok, this is definitely a safe place from carbs. You can use any oil you want and it won't have any carbs. 

&nbsp;

I love cooking with olive oil and grass fed butter. Also, I use bacon grease for cooking as well. I save it in a bottle, after cooking bacon, and use it to bring out that applewood flavor in my other dishes.

&nbsp;

# Eggs and Dairy

Eggs and cheese are the staples of a low-carb, ketogenic diet. Most food labels will tell you that cheese and eggs contain no carbs.

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, they have some carbs. Not a lot, but they do.

&nbsp;

One large egg, for example, has 0.40g net carbs.

&nbsp;

What about cheese? Carbs in cheese can vary from 0.1g to 12g per slice.

&nbsp;

**Here is a list of low net carb cheese options per slice (30g):**

* Asiago (0.91g)
* Blue (0.66g)
* Brie (0.13g)
* Camembert (0.13g)
* Cheddar (0.36g)
* Colby (0.72g)
* Edam (0.41g)
* Fontina (0.43)
* Goat (0.62g)
* Gouda (0.63g)
* Gruyere (0.10g)
* Havarti (0.79g)
* Mexican Blend (0.54g)
* Monterey (0.19g)
* Mozzarella (0.62g)
* Muenster (0.31g)
* Parmesan (0.91g)
* Provolone (0.60g)
* Ricotta (0.86g)

&nbsp;

If you like other dairy products, like milk, I would suggest buying heavy cream (0.3g per tbsp) or half and half (0.2g per tbsp).

&nbsp;

# Almost No carb snacks

I personally can't live without snacks. It is how I cope with my cravings. The importance of finding no carb snacks was crucial. 

&nbsp;

**Here is a list of no carb snacks as well as snacks that I very low in net carbs:**

* Pepperoni Slices (0.5g per 14 slices)
* String Cheese (0.7g per stick)
* Pork Rinds (0g)
* Peanut Butter (2g per tbsp)
* No Sugar Jello (2g per cup)
* Pepperoni sticks (1g per stick)
* Biltong (0.3g per piece)
* Seaweed (0.02g per strip)
* Baked zucchini chips (0.04g per piece)
* Almonds (2.5g per 30 grams)
* Sunflower Seeds (2.5g per 30 grams)

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

There are not that many no carb foods out there. On top of it, food companies make it very difficult to identify truly zero carb foods. 

&nbsp;

Even though we are trying to stick to our macros, it is important not to get paranoid about your carb intake. All of the foods listed above are very low/zero carb and keto friendly. 

&nbsp;

Try to eat healthily and keep your carbs between 20-50g to stay within your [ketogenic diet plan](http://www.ketogeniclab.com/ketogenic-diet-meal-plan).

The first month was tough because I was used to going to fast food and eating whatever was available in front of me. I mean I wore layers during the summer for god sakes. However once I got over that hump with the encouragement of my best friend who did this diet himself I hit my stride. 2 months in i started to be more active happier more social even went back to school because of this. I was being the best version of myself through this process and it took only just 7 months November of 2019 to make a transformation. Anyways back to my proudest moment. I went to the doctors for a check up the first time in years. Last time I went I had to use a special scale for the doctors to weigh me. But last week I stepped on a regular scale in the exam room and it said 330!!! 330 I lost nearly 80lbs in 7 months. I almost cried because I used a scale like that for the first time since I was a teen and 2 this journey has made me realize what I can get out of life if I put work into it.

Asked my wife to bring me Mediums.... Too big. The Small fit like a glove. I broke down in the middle of the fitting room. I've NEVER worn a size Small. 

Went to try on pants next. Prior to my weight loss I was wearing a 38/40 pants. That day I bought size 33 SKINNY PANTS. Another, albeit smaller, breakdown ensued. 

Needless to say it was a very positive and emotional shopping experience.

I was thisclose in January to getting bariatric surgery - an obesity specialist told me (very nicely btw) that my only hope of losing weight was to have a gastric sleeve or gastric bypass.  I decided to give losing weight one last go, fell into keto and learned SO MUCH from people here on this sub.  I still have a ways to go ... BUT HOLY MACARONI I'VE LOST 100 LBS IN 6 MONTHS.  (And I ain't no spring chicken either - I'm 47.   If I can do this - with zero exercise mind you - it is entirely possible for anyone to be successful with keto.)

So literally, yay me!  I have never been so proud of myself in my whole life.  :)

"I did keto 2 years ago and lost weight successfully. 2 years later, I'm doing the exact same thing and not losing weight. What is it I'm doing wrong?",0,jeto37,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jeto37/i_did_keto_2_years_ago_and_lost_weight/,7,1603242061.0,"I'm posting here to see if I can gain some insight as to why keto doesn't seem to be working for me this time around, when 2 years ago I had successful results with it.

In 2018, I did keto for about 7 months and lost between 20-30 lbs. I didn't track macros and did things the ""dirty"" way, while aiming for a carb count of 50g a day. I didn't want to be overly strict about it because I wanted it to be scalable in the grand scheme of my life (eg. I wanted to still be able to go to restaurants with friends and not worry about counting what was in my meal) and I didn't want to feel like it was too overwhelming to do. I only stopped doing it when my hair started falling out (I've since learned why this happens, but at the time it gave me a scare).

In 2019, I didn't return to a keto lifestyle but I did try my best to maintain eating low carb meals as much as possible. I'd say I gained maybe 5-10 lbs back, but I didn't gain all of the weight I lost back and was able to keep most of it off.

That is, of course, until the lockdown of 2020. During this time, my cat also passed away, I went into a depression and for 2-3 months of staying at home and pretty much going nowhere due to COVID, I ate just about everything in sight. I definitely gained all the weight back, which was why this summer I finally decided to go back to doing keto the way I had done it 2 years ago.

It's now been 3 months since going back to keto and I feel like I am not losing any weight. This isn't at all going the same way it did 2 years ago, and I'm just not sure why. I've since highlighted the key differences in my life between now and 2018 to try to figure out if any of them are related. These are the main ones:

* In 2018, I had lost my full time job and for a while I was on employment benefits/doing freelance work. I'm not a morning person at all, so during most of this time I slept in later every day and got adequate sleep on most days, even if it was during irregular hours. Now, I'm back to a regular 9-5 job, work extremely long hours and am constantly stressed and burnt out -- which has resulted in me sometimes running on very little sleep. I am wondering if this has had an effect on my cortisol levels or my metabolism.
* Because for a while I didn't have to follow a 9-5 schedule in 2018 and wasn't working full time, I guess it was normal for me to be out and doing things during ""regular"" work hours. I'm wondering if this resulted in me getting more exercise in the day, even though I didn't really make note of it at the time. In 2020, on the other hand, I've been working from home since March and am now pretty much required to spend 8+ hours a day sitting in one spot at home. My job is demanding and it can sometimes be hard to even take a break to go for a walk or exercise.
* COVID was obviously not happening in 2018, meaning it wasn't a source of stress that year. I was actually extremely stressed about my work situation that year, but due to being able to sleep better and getting some time to recharge, I feel like it's not the same stress I'm feeling today over the demands of my current job and the pandemic.

I'd love to know what I can do to make changes here, as well as whether any of these details may be related to why I'm doing literally the EXACT same thing I did 2 years ago but am not losing weight. I do realize I need to find time for more exercise and feel like that's a given, but at the same time I'm frustrated that this isn't giving me the same results. Thanks!",1

Today I had a crazy thought and decided to try something. I have been working my upper body pretty hard, trying to even out my body composition. I have lost the majority of my weight in my torso, as that is where I was carrying the bulk of it. So today I got down on the floor and told myself 'You're doing a damn push up if it kills you'. I haven't been able to do a push up in my entire life. I know, pathetic right... well today that all changed. I FINALLY DID ONE! I couldn't believe it... still don't really.

I'm 25, M, 10% BF.

I love Keto. Still do. Was one it for 3+ months and got incredibly ripped and had wonderful mental cognition.

However, whether due to genetics or my relative leanness to begin with, I experienced pretty debilitating adrenal fatigue (HPA Axis Dysfunction) when I tried to maintain strict adherence when switching to a pretty aggressive bulk and weightlifting regimen (with OMAD/IF thrown in). While Keto is often incredibly helpful and certainly even life-changing for some, it might not be recommended long-term for *every* individual. Bio-individuality is important!

To understand what was wrong with me, I took various tests (both clinical and subclinical) and found out that I had maladaptive stress leading to a wonky diurnal rhythm and unpredictable cortisol spikes. Would sleep 10 hours, feel terrible in the morning, yet randomly wired and anxious trying to go to bed. Took me about a month of steadily consuming a moderate amount of low-glycemic complex carbs for me to heal from that fatigue. Reading up on it now, I should likely have been incorporating carb cycling into the equation - as I was excessively pushing my sympathetic nervous system with my strict adherence plus excessive intense exercise.

TL;DR: Keto is a stressor on the body. It might not be a massive one if utilized properly, **and it may actually stress some far more than others**, but it *can* lead to burnout if combined with a host of other inflammatory stressors (poor diet choices, excessive fasting, too much intense exercise, not enough recovery, emotional or physical trauma, exposure to heavy metals & toxins etc). Adaptive stress is good! Chronic stress is bad!

Just wanted to throw this up for anyone who might be in a similar situation and needs help. Feel free to DM me re: recovery specifics + diagnosis tips :)",1

It's helped an untold amount of people lose weight, improve cholesterol and other bio-markers, fix wrecked metabolisms, correct hormonal imbalances, etc. This much is inarguable.

The hivemind of this sub had undergone several changes in last five years or so. Posts glorifying fat bombs, bulletproof coffee, and percentages/ratios have now given way to counting calories, net vs total carbs, and intermittent fasting. Which brings me to my main point:

The Ketogenic Diet is an amazing introduction to the application of carbohydrate restriction to better oneself. But after awhile, most people seem to go one of two ways. Those who firmly believe in applying CICO to Keto keep cutting their calories (dietary fat) as they lose weight, ultimately ending up somewhere close to a Protein Sparing Modified Fast (PSMF). Those that are only interested in eliminating carbohydrates but believe tracking calories doesn't matter end up eliminating those last 20g of leafy green veggie carbs per day and shift to a zerocarb/carnivorous way of eating. The trend seems to be that most people begin their LCFH journey with Keto, then shift to another LC application when they feel a change needs to be made.

Now that we're in 2020, Keto feels like that 100/101 Intro course you had to take in college. You sign up, attend the lectures, ace the quiz's and exams and get that easy A. After you're done you either move onto a different course (i.e. a different diet), or you sign up for those 200-level courses and beyond and delve deeper into the research and dogma of your preferred area of study.

I'm not saying that PSMF, ZC, or just staying on Keto is good or bad; you are the purveyor of your own success, and we each have a responsibility to understand our own bodies and find what works best. I just felt like there were some trends that were occurring here as of late, and I wanted to get my thoughts out of my head and into a post to generate some thought-provoking discussion.

I’m confused because I feel like I’m a healthy eater. I follow the daily dozen and eat Whole Foods. I take vitamin b12 supplement and iron supplement. And yet I look awful. I’ve explained this to my doctor and have my told to go back to eating meat. Which I refuse to do. But also I can’t keep having declining health.

I just want to know what to do. I’m at my wits ends. I don’t drink or smoke, so it’s not like this is impacting my health. 

Also, have you noticed that YouTube vegans have aged rapidly compared to meat eaters? Such as Ellen fisher, Bonny Rebecca, freelee, Kristina, alyse, etc...they all look a lot older than they are yet eat such a healthy diet. 

Please any advice you can give.

My ratios were about 65% Fat with 5 to 10% Carbs and the rest Protein. I knew I had to increase my fat levels somehow (EDIT: to help with feeling more satiated after increasing my protein's didn't work) but had been struggling with it even after adding more butters and oils. I decided, even though I didn't drink coffee, to try keto coffee. On the days I consume it in the morning I haven't needed to eat until around 2pm and my fats have been hovering at around 80% on those days! I think I'm going to start drinking keto coffee everyday and, for anyone who is hesitant about it due to the taste or the fact that you don't drink coffee, I'd say go for it!  I used ruled.me's recipe as a baseline and use 3 truvia as my sweetener and forgo the vanilla extract. 

P. S. If you have a Grocery Outlet in your area they may have both MCT oil and Ghee and sub $10 for large containers of both!

EDIT: To be clear I didn't mean to imply that I was trying to increase my fats to meet an arbitrary goal of 75% fat or higher. I meant to say that I wanted to increase my fat intake because after doing higher protein I found I was still hungry half the month and wanted to increase my fats to combat that.

I have done 7 day fasts, I eat omd yet nothing happened. I had gone weeks at 0 carbs and still nothing!!

3 weeks ago I started dropping weight. I went from 184lbs to 173.5lbs this morning. What changed? Years ago I was a cabinetmaker and I hated working for a overbearing egotistical prick so I quit and went into a different line of work. I still loved building kitchens and other things so I did these as side jobs. 

A month ago I decided to give up the side jobs, sell off the specialized tools and just use my extra time for myself and my family. I now realize that the constant stress of working all day then coming home and working several hours more on projects was a huge source of stress (cortisol). Weekends were spent in the shop or working at people’s houses and I was never able to just unwind. 

Once I finished my last side job and started to get rid of tools, I felt like a huge weight was lifted off of me. I don’t feel anxious if I try to relax, I don’t have time constraints on things I enjoy doing and my home life is much happier. I never thought I was under that much stress until i wasn’t under stress. 

I’m still well under 40g carbs per day but when I go camping I will indulge and still I am losing weight. If you are having issues with weight loss, consider ways to reduce/eliminate stress, it does make a difference.",1

I got angry today...,1500,bmm78b,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/bmm78b/i_got_angry_today/,449,1557449681.0,"I have been on Keto since Monday - I am an educated and intelligent guy, with a great job, gorgeous wife and nothing much to complain about.  I have struggled with my weight for about 20 years but towards the end of 2016 I decided to do something about.  I was getting married the following March and set a goal to lose some weight before the wedding - it was a dream wedding on a beach in Mauritius - so obviously I wanted to look good and at 110kg with a fiance who is 60kg wet - I wanted to look good for her as well as myself.

So I got a personal trainer and hit the gym 5-6 days a week for 2-3 hours a day doing very intensive strength training + cardio and on a very strict macro controlled diet (protein/carb based) as well as a bunch of supplements.  I won't lie, it was hard as fuck - but it worked, I got to 96kg in 4 months and gained a lot of muscle; and our wedding was magical.

The problem is, I then had a lot of travel with my job for the rest of the year which meant my diet and training regime basically went to shit - hard to keep control when you spend over 180 days of the year in airports and hotels, so I just yo-yo'd, now back up to 115kg.

Now I have a bunch of friends in Canada (I live in Sweden) who have been doing keto for a couple of years and they look fantastic - I mean absolutely fantastic; so I started to do some research a couple of weeks back on Keto myself.  I do about 30-50 public speaking engagements a year - I don't want to be a fat bastard on stage in front of thousands of people, I want people to focus on what I am talking about, not how out of breath I am or how much I am sweating because I am obese.

So I researched (and when I research I research hard) and as someone who works in Human Rights, I became disgusted with the death we have all been sold for the last 40-50 years.  The conspiracy that exists between sugar industry, processed food industry, big pharma, academia and government to ensure that we keep filling our lives with carbs just really pisses me off.

Then today, when I went to 3 supermarkets to stock up on my keto friendly food, I just became furious.  Every single aisle full of sugar and carbs - every single planagram designed to make you eat more sugar and carbs.  The candy aisle, the icecream aisle, the bread aisle, the cake aisle, the baking aisle, the chips aisle, the packaged food aisle - everywhere I looked all I could see was sugar and carbs.  It is twisted beyond belief.

And it occurred to me - the thing that people have often teased me over for years is my love of meat and dairy (cheese more specifically) - I shit you not, I was once dumped by a girl in college because she claimed I ate too much cheese - this love of meat and cheese wasn't a bad thing, it was my body crying out to me to eat the right fucking food.

So yeah, those of us working to meet our goals, to lose the pounds/kilos - to have a healthy body and mind; we call ourselves fat, we have low self esteem and negative body image - but we are all victims.  We didn't choose to be this way, we were farmed like cattle by these industries and our own governments.

So I am not ashamed any more, I am determined; determined to be my own person and to be natural.  I read earlier this week that we have gone from an average consumption of 5lbs of sugar per year to 150lbs in the last 160 years and that the sugar lobby spend more money than the tobacco lobby - I mean seriously, wtf?

So I want to say thank you to everyone here who has shared their story (it is incredibly inspiring, no seriously - those before and after pics are completely mind blowing) and to those who have developed the knowledge resources, the tools and support infrastructure which gives us all the opportunity to take back control of our lives.

I have just started my journey - but my eyes are wide open and nothing motivates me more than raging against the machine, so I \*know\* I will succeed.",1
I got my Mom and very sick Father to go on keto for 3 months. Blood tests came back for my Dad and he saw HUGE improvements!,3047,ciobx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/ciobx8/i_got_my_mom_and_very_sick_father_to_go_on_keto/,64,1564297648.0,"My father has been struggling with many illnesses his entire life, and more keep popping up as he ages (only 45). He’s had 3 heart attacks, an 11 rating on his blood sugar, bladder cancer for 4 years, lost his job, ran out of unemployment, the whole nine yards. I’m so proud of him for sticking through it all. Even though he might be grumpy sometimes, he has great reasons to be. 

I did keto myself for 6 months with great success. I lost a good 50lbs. I knew what the diet could do if you gave it time. My father got his blood tests (this was 3 months ago) and everything was looking horrible. He was in the worse ranges for all of his illnesses. That’s when I told him straight up “Dad, I love you. I want you to live longer and to feel better. I know of a diet that can alleviate some of these things. Let me help.” 

Obviously I got a big fat no and he dismissed it, but after a week of slightly dropping the idea into conversations, something changed. He realized all the things he was currently missing and wanted to see and do. That’s when he told me that we can do the diet, but only if the whole family does it together.

So that’s what we did! We made family keto meals for 3 months. My dad got really into pork rinds and guacamole. We started making collagen shakes. We even started stretching and doing light exercises. My dad even got on the exercise bike a few times!

Then my parents went on vacation. There they decided that they will eat well for a month and then pig out at Disney world. Later in their stay, that’s when they got the blood tests results. My mom told me that my dad was scared to death of opening the results. He didn’t want to know he would die. It was too much for him to handle.

That’s when my mom shared the great news! His blood sugar was looking close to what a normal level would be. His cholesterol was better than what it was before his first heart attack! We really were turning back the clock!

I’m just so happy that this all worked out. Those 3 months of struggle and learning was a tremendous boon to his health and lifespan. They even said they were going back on the diet before they got home from vacation. All the doctors are really impressed.

I just can’t thank this community enough. Without this subreddit my dad could’ve been dead. All of you who helped contribute with information and recipes really did save my dads life and give him a few more years. I can’t thank you guys enough. You’re a wonderful community

"I grew up in a low carb household, but have since transitioned to a WFPB diet.",278,d2y82a,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/d2y82a/i_grew_up_in_a_low_carb_household_but_have_since/,28,1568269796.0,"Hi everyone, my name is gleeXanadu. I grew up in a low-carb household and this is my story.

For my whole childhood my parents were strong supporters of Atkins. I learned at a young age that carbs are bad. I remember as a little girl going to the health food store with my mom and experiencing such cognitive dissonance looking at the grocery cart of this one particular lady. Her cart was full to the brim will all sorts of fruits. I remember wondering ""How can this woman be skinny if she has so many fruits in her cart? Is she going to eat all those? Are fruits carbs, and carbs make you fat, right?"" Ultimately I figured that since she didn't have any weight to lose that she could afford to eat all the fruit she wanted. 

I would eat what my parents made for me. My mom doesn't like vegetables, so I didn't eat any ""real"" veggies growing up. I wish I were exaggerating. The most vegetables we saw were salad mix, carrots, tomatoes, and onions. **I remember one night sitting down to a plate of pork rinds and velveeta cheese dip and I was told that it was a healthy dinner**. (God bless my parents though. I know they thought they were doing the right thing.) Salads were covered in oily dressings, berries were served with heavy cream on top. 

Unfortunately after following Atkins for so long my parents suffered some real health consequences. My dad developed conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis, severe coronary calcium deposits, kidney stones, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Somehow my mom didn't turn out as bad as my dad. However, she did still have high cholesterol and high blood pressure even after years of ""dieting"".

Fortunately I found plant based eating years ago in 2012. I learned how to cook vegetables! I never really ate them much, so I honestly had no idea that I liked them. I actually got a lot more variety in my diet after switching to a plant based diet. I remember being amazed at how many different kinds of foods I was eating that I had never had before. Zucchini, broccoli, brussels sprouts, eggplant, acorn squash, kale, mango, papaya, chickpeas, the list went on!

Eventually I started eating meat again for social reasons, but I have since come back around to plant based eating. This time I'm not just doing plant based. I'm doing WFPB, and the difference over the past month has been great.

I'm only 26 and yet there have been so many days in the past year when I've woken up to my fingers feeling inflamed, swollen, and un-bendable. I'm happy to say that I have experienced no such inflammation in the past month, and that I have been feeling great overall. Not to mention that the pounds have absolutely been melting off of me with seemingly no effort on my part. My skin looks clearer, and I look more vibrant in general. I have more bounce in my step.

I've also managed to convince my folks, finally, after all these years, that low carb isn't everything that they thought it was. In the past couple months they've finally realized (or at least my dad has) that fewer animal products are better for your health and the environment. My dad no longer suffers from kidney stones, his cholesterol and BP are down, and his liver is doing better. His heart disease is still present, but has not progressed.

I'm glad to say that my folks now drink green fruit smoothies on the regular and are putting at least some effort into cutting back on their meat consumption. They're also under the supervision of a doctor that promotes a largely WFPB lifestyle, and their health has significantly improved since they've stopped eating so much bacon and cheese and have started to eat more produce.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading! I just wanted to share. Thanks to everyone here and all your awesome support :)

TL;DR: I was raised in a low carb household, and the whole family suffered from ill health effects for some time. Now we've all made an effort to (mostly) adhere to WFPB and everyone is doing better.

Edit: I forgot to mention that I was diagnosed with insulin resistance as a teen despite being active and maintaining a healthy weight. I tested my fasting blood sugar the other day and it was 80 mg/dL and my 1.5 post-meal blood sugar was 122mg/dL. Those are both well withing the normal range and I'm happy about it.",0

I run my own business as a graphic designer, filmmaker, photographer and I do web design(when you’re an entrepreneur you do what will make you money.) Anyways I decided after 3 years to get a part time job and even some people have sent me jobs, but I passed to pursue my passion. Well, UPS was advertised to me by someone I know who has been there for over 15 years and it was paying $18.75 for newbies during the season. I learned to drive a stick after sending my application off since the driver position had that requirement. I mean I was practicing on friend’s manual cars for days and hours. I got it down pack just so I could pass the driver test. I went for the interview and passed that, did the driving test the same day and I passed it! I waited a week before following up to see when I would have to go to school, the HR person had no record of my driving test but took my word for it that I had passed. Awesome! I then was told to go to take my physical and DOT(some assessment for driving big vehicles or something?), and I would be going for training this upcoming Sunday in Lake Mary, FL. In the waiting room I was studying for the test, I was just super excited and determined to pass the assessments I’d have to take while away at training. 

Here is where things got triumphant! 

The cute young lady brought me to the back, she took my blood pressure (perfect!) I have not been to a doctors office in over 4 years, last time I went I got the worst results for everything and placed on high blood pressure water pills which I stopped taking shortly after. Anyways, y’all! I had to get on the SCALE. I’m not totally in the dark, but last time I stepped on a doctor’s scale they just couldn’t get my weight because I was well over 350 or whatever the limit was. This time the limit was 450 and not expecting much she took my weight to be 327. I got so excited she has to tell me to stay still, it was so nice to see those numbers! I promise! I did a happy dance, I explained to her why I was so ecstatic and she agreed it was awesome. 

Now, for the heartbreak... 

I waited for 10 minutes in the room for the doctor, stars in my eyes, on a high. The doctor came and asked me questions, I answered and he said to me “you need to have a sleep study done” you are too much overweight and I can’t pass you with that” I confirmed what I was hearing, that I would not get this position. I pleaded like “sir I’ve lost like 90lbs I don’t need a sleep study, I guarantee. I have more energy and everything. I haven’t felt sleep driving ever since losing this much weight. I can do this” and he insisted my BMI was 43 and the disqualification was 40 and above. I was crushed overall that I wouldn’t get the job. Like almost about to cry. I would have to be 295 in order to reapply for this along with doing a mandatory sleep study before I could pass. Well, I told the people at headquarters and they offered me a warehouse position and felt bad that I didn’t pass the DOT. I was so happy about my result and so disappointed at where they landed me. A woman in the office on her own weight loss journey reassured me “you have to look at it positively because at least you’re only 3% away that’s awesome.” 

I said I was going to keep it short, sorry I lied. But I got an old picture of me and needless to say I started feeling myself! Haha! If you read this far you’re the real MVP! Pictures are 415lbs in Dec 2018 to 327 today, Oct 2019. [Before & After Pics ](https://imgur.com/gallery/OI69VJK)",1

I am always struggling between a normal bmi and overweight. Keto has been the only thing that helps me break a plateau but I keep binging after awhile. The fact my weight loss slowed, discovering the word small fat (seriously if you go from obese to normal you shouldn't have to be called fat, it's not fair.) and the fact that summer is here and I still have a gut is just devastating.

 I seeked psychological help because I'm waking up depressed when I binge and fighting urges from trying thinspo diets. They said they see me yesterday or today, no call back. I told my cousin that after a bad day today I wanted to eat but I'm fasting (she knows I'm seeking help) all she sent is a text clarifying what was wrong...nobody cares. 

I am trying a diet I won't name because don't want others to follow but the most I'll eat is 500 cals. I  looked it up and as long as I return to healthy eating (keto) and don't starve myself for too long (10 days) I shouldn't gain it all back. Now here I am at almost 6pm and all I had to eat was water and an energy drink because day 1 is fasting.

Ok so what you do is you make a nice beefy casserole - I chose /u/cavemanketo's Mexican Spinach. Then, after having a serving, you totally get distracted, and forget that the dish is standing exposed, in the open air, overnight.

In the morning, remember, but (and this is the key to success) say fuck it, and portion it up anyway. Now, about an hour after having it for lunch, you'll notice the first twinges of impending ultra weightloss. Shortly thereafter, the weight will quite literally just flow out of you, via any orifice it can find. 

This is amazing! I am about six pounds down in the last 12 hours! Genius!

No but seriously folks, proper handling of food is a must.  I'm wrecked, going to have to binge on Cocacola and Rehydrat to survive this, which is of course going to fuck up my macros. I guess I have to start over. Hope the carb withdrawal isn't as bad this time.",1

I gained a LOT of weight in the past 4 years. Mentally I am also not doing that great and one of the reason is because I am now so damn fat. I moved to another country 4 years ago and it was hard. My parents both passed away in the last 3 years, 2 miscarriages, 2 full pregnancies.

I've always struggled with my weight, I've always done low calories/low fat/low carbs diets before. I've lost so many times in the past 15 years over 100pounds that way, but then I always go back to my bad habits because I stop eating everything that I like on those diets. I do not want to have to starve myself to lose that much weight. I am addicted to sugar,  I could eat pasta all day long.

I weight 275pounds, I'm 5'7, 33yo female. I have a hypothyroidism problem (been on the same dosage for about 17years) has keto affected your medication's dosage? have you been able to lose a good amount of weight with Keto? is it a struggle?

Guys. It’s officially been two entire years since the day my doctor called me, and told me if I didn’t change my life now, I would be full blown diabetic incredibly soon. It was one of the worst days in my life. The tears, they just wouldn’t stop flowing. I couldn’t believe how bad I let my health go. 

At 263lbs, and only 24 years old, I was prediabetic. I completely stopped getting my period. My bad cholesterol was..bad. And the good cholesterol? Also bad. My body..it ached. Every day. By the time I got off work, I quite literally felt crippled. My feet, killing me from the weight it had to hold all day. My little boy, wanting to play, and run with his mother, and I tried, I just couldn’t do it for long. While the physical ailments were horrible, the mental anguish hurt just as much. 

“How could you let yourself get to this point?” I needed a change, and I needed it immediately.

That’s when I found you guys. This community. I went through tons and tons of posts here, and I figured “If they can do it, I can do it too” So I did. The content here, and the people who so bravely posted, and so kindly offered support and advice to one another was instrumental in my own progress. 

These past two years have at times, been very challenging. Completely changing your aspect on food, and what it does to, and FOR your body has been the biggest hurdle. Giving your brain time to catch up to this sudden physical change, has been hard too. But let me tell you something..

IT WAS WORTH EVERY SINGLE BIT OF IT. My doctor, the one who told me about my prediabetic state is elated. She has never seen anyone make a turn around like this. My bad cholesterol? GREAT. My good cholesterol? AMAZING. My blood sugar? IMPECCABLE. My back? Well..it still hurts sometimes haha, that’s just from getting older I suppose. 😆 I’m now 141lbs. I went from a size 20 in jeans, to a 7. 2/3XL to a small. I HAVE A REGULAR PERIODS GUYS. Who knew you can be so happy about Aunt Flo coming every month? 

Anyways, I just wanted to share my progress, and really hope to serve as some sort of encouragement to anyone else who really feels like they’re stuck or defeated and overwhelmed. You’re not. You’re stronger and more resilient than you think. KCKO everyone!

Edit: Wow guys, thank you SO MUCH for all the uplifting, encouraging, amazingly nice comments. I’m so thankful for this place, and the people who come here. And holy crap, THANK YOU FOR THE GOLD! 😭",1

I had tried many other diets in the past. I thought I was eating healthy and I just did not understand why I wasn’t losing the weight. In fact, I was putting more on by the day. 

After finally getting tired of the way that I looked, I buckled down and made this my resolution. I did not expect much. I thought this would turn out like any other diet I had tried. I didn’t believe the hype. I thought there was no way that eating fat would help me to lose weight. 

Lo and behold, here I am, over 50 pounds lighter. Lighter than I have been in my adult life. I feel great. I look great. And stepping on the scale this morning, my girlfriend thought I was losing my marbles because I started CRYING. 

This isn’t the end of my keto journey. I have decided that I will continue this way of eating, because I enjoy it so much. I don’t feel deprived or starved. I don’t crave the sweets or starches anymore. I no longer have acid reflux, bloating, or digestive issues. My lifelong acne is GONE. My skin is glowing. 

I am so thankful for this sub. I could not have lost this weight without keto. It truly is a miracle diet :)

On a pleasant note this is my second go with keto, the first time took me from about 295-225, now I've been back at it for a month and I'm down 20lbs. Keto has improved my quality of life drastically and saved my knees. Thanks for reading, y'all have an amazing day!

Things keto did for me (or rather, I did for myself through keto): 

* tightly controlled my diabetes

* no more blood pressure meds

* so much energy

* changed my entire life

* fixed my relationship with food

* taught me who my real friends are

* increased my iron levels

* helped me find my love of cooking again

* gave me my collarbones back 

* no more PCOS symptoms and my period is totally normal now


Things keto didn't do for me: 

* fix my depression and anxiety

I know this sounds counterproductive, like why am I telling you guys this? But in all honesty I've been seeing so many posts about ""keto solved all my mental health problems"" and while I am so happy for the people experiencing this, I've spent a lot of time wondering ""what's wrong with me"", ""why isn't it working"". 

So I wanted to tell those of you on here that haven't been magically fixed that it's ok. Keto is amazing, keto is how I live from here on out, keto will make you feel like a super hero, but keto is not a magic pill. I continue to struggle with my mental health, daily. But that's ok because at least I am not also a hypertensive diabetic. 

Edit1: Thank you for the kind words, you guys rock. It's always so awesome when you say something and everyone else goes ""me too"". 

Edit2: For those of you considering starting because you want it to help with this stuff... it did help me. In my first year I felt so much better. I rode that high all the way from March 2016 to Jan 2017. It was amazing. I DID feel better. I DO feel better but it doesn't solve my chemical/genetic problems. I shudder to think how bad it would be if I hadn't started keto. So do it. You won't regret a single day.

"I need help getting back on keto, but on a limited budget.",0,j9ovca,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/j9ovca/i_need_help_getting_back_on_keto_but_on_a_limited/,53,1602529394.0,"This post may seem a little off topic at first glance, but I promise it isn’t. It’s a little long, but all very relevant to my keto dilemma, and I’m in desperate need of help to get back on keto, my health depends on it. 

Edit: I just want to say I’ve already read everything I could find about doing keto on a budget.. but it’s not enough, I still can’t seem to afford it. Please just read my story.. it explains a lot better the circumstances. 

For years I struggled with weight issues. After a very lengthy struggle with multiple doctors I was diagnosed with PCOS. Even though I finally had a diagnosis, I was offered little medical advice from my doctors. They essentially told me I had to loose weight. Loosing weight will not cure, but at least improve the symptoms, but having PCOS makes loosing weight difficult.. so good luck. After doing lots of my own research I discovered keto, and it changed my life. Regular diets would never work because I developed insulin resistance from the PCOS, which basically means my body doesn’t know what to do with the insulin’s that the consumption of carbs created to use as energy. It made sense that I was always hungry because the carbs weren’t registering as energy, and my body always thought I was trying to starve it, and when your body thinks it’s starving it holds on to every bit of fat for dear life, and a back up fuel source. This made me realize the only logical way for me to possibly loose weight was to make my body use the fat as it’s main fuel source, since it didn’t know what to do with carbs and insulin anyway.. this is essentially the keto diet. I started my keto journey March 2018, a year later I was down almost 120 Lbs, and felt better than i had.. pretty much ever. I ended up back at school to finish my HS Diploma, something I tried a to accomplish a few times before, but my health issues always got in the way. Things in my life suddenly got very complicated, and my living situation changed drastically, in some ways for the better, but in some ways it’s was way more of a struggle. I made the decision to stop keto, because I couldn’t afford it at the time.. but I said as soon as I was able to I would get right back on. Surprisingly the year and a bit I did of keto seemed to fix something in my body. I was eating carbs again in moderation because I didn’t have a choice, but I was still getting full easily and staying full as if I was still on keto. Despite living with someone who lives on sugar and sweets, and enjoying them myself I was still loosing weight for some reason... I felt a lot healthier in general so I was more active, and unconsciously still limiting my carb intake without even realizing it, I just didn’t crave carbs like I used to before keto. Then my life got even more complicated due to a bunch of circumstances that are a really long story.. the result was my boyfriend and I attempting to survive off of less than 400$ a month with 3 cats to feed, our food budget was barely existent and neither me nor my boyfriend where in a position to change our situation at the time. We lived off of mostly rice, and potatoes because of how cheap and filling they were. Finally my boyfriend was able to get a decent paying job. I was almost free of my other responsibilities (that were a result of the complicated circumstances I was faced with) to look for a job of my own, not even a week later Covid-19 hit... my boyfriends new job shut down, he was put on the 2000$/month CERB benefit, which was a huge salary improvement at first. Then of course more stuff had to go wrong, my boyfriends mother (who lives in the apartment downstairs from us) was an essential worker who’s job happened to be at the complete other end of the city (a 4 hour bus ride away) two days into the pandemic her car completely died, it was impossible for her to take the bus, even if she caught the first bus at the crack of dawn would be 3 hours late for work. She had to spend money she didn’t have to buy the first car she found. Our stove and fridge both broke in the same day upstairs, and we had no way to cook or store food, everything was closed due to the pandemic so we couldn’t even get them repaired. His moms new car kept breaking down on her, and we had to put one of our cats down a month into the pandemic. It was literally a disaster, we had no choice but to live off fast food, McDonald’s to be precise because it was the cheapest. This totally ruined any residual keto magic I had left over. And I started gaining weight again fast.. I’ve been struggling ever since. My health is back to being very bad, and while I’m still 80 Lbs down from my starting weight.. the 3 months of fast food did a number on me. My boyfriend now has a new very decent job, my health conditions have stopped me from being able to find a job. We are living on one salary, and while it’s way better than the 400$ a month struggle we made it through, our expenses have also gone up. His mother was paying half the rent and the hydro to our place to help us out, now she isn’t. I tried to go back on keto, the way I knew how. I got used to eating a certain way when I started keto, and the majority of foods I have always ate as part of my keto meal plan is way to expensive, and the food prices are just going up as a result of the pandemic and economy. Not only do I have to feed my self, I have to make meals for my boyfriend as well, sure some keto friendly foods are universal, and he would eat normally... but a lot isn’t stuff he would eat. Our budget every two weeks for food is 120$ but other things need to be bought out of that money as well, cat food (wet and dry) cat litter, other household necessities like shampoo/soap/cleaning products/ laundry detergent/toilet paper.. obviously not every item every two weeks but at least each paycheque I need to buy a few things from that list, and cat food and litter is every two weeks no exception. I need ideas.. what is the absolute cheapest way to eat keto? I’m starting from absolute scratch again, so the not being hungry like ever perk of keto takes a few months of strict keto to kick in properly. Last time I started keto I ate a lot at first until my body adjusted.. but I can’t afford to do that this time. I feel like absolute garbage about myself, I gained 40 lbs since Covid started, and I’m having self esteem issues that are affecting my otherwise perfect relationship. I have zero energy, and barely leave the house (I have every high risk factor for Covid complications possible) so I’m really trying to avoid getting it at all costs, my PCOS symptoms and my auto immune disorder that keto helped immensely are both back in full force, and causing a lot of complications and pain in my life right now. Yes loosing weight on keto is great for many reasons, but my main concern is my health.. and keto is the only thing in 20 years that has ever worked for me, i see keto as a medication, the only medication that has ever helped, but that I can’t afford. I desperately need to figure out how to get through the first few months of strict keto on barely any money.. once I’m back to the barely ever hungry stage, I think I can manage on a super tiny budget... it’s the getting there that I can’t figure out. The few times I’ve tried I’ve only lasted a week on what I could afford, and then I’m forced to break keto and eat carbs to survive for the next week. So I need to start back at the beginning. And I don’t know if this is an actual thing or not, but I feel like the starting and stopping of going into ketosis is doing more harm than good. I feel like the keto flu never ends, and I feel like I’m constantly sick and more worn down than normal and that’s saying something. It takes me 4-5 days to get into full ketosis, and then two days later I have nothing to eat but carbs. Please I’m desperate for advice!",1

I have been vegan for a good 6 months now, but I've been slightly struggling with it in all honesty, and would definitely love if I could iron the problems out since I don't wanna leave the whole cause just like that.

I can't quite pinpoint what the issue is, even tho I may have an idea. And there's multiple culprits at that.

It's gonna be a bit of a long one, and I hope you have the patience to read all this. Thank you in advance.
So here it goes.

1. My diet is pretty much a high fat and high carb diet.
I eat nuts and nut butters of all kinds. Everything ranging from almonds, hazel, peanuts, sunflower, flax. etc.
There's basically 10 different nuts I eat every day at around a 25 to 40 grams range. And they're all usually activated as well, to remove some of the phytic acid.
And they hold at about a 1500 calories alone.
Idk if it's that much of an issue, at first I feel satiated but later I do feel a bit of hunger despite of how much I ate of them. 
There's about 50g of Omega 6's per day.
Idk if it's that much of an issue, but I hope it's not.
I love nuts.

2. The carbs on the other hand, besides the nuts.
Beans, oats, lentils, tomato and cucumber are what I go with. Others are just occasional but the main point is that there isn't a lot of starch besides oats.
-Which got me thinking that this could be part of the issue.
There were days where I just couldn't resist eating whole bags of potato chips.
I would hate myself for eating that much Lays, but I would be lying if I said that I didn't feel satiated for the next day.
But then again.

3. I also intermittently fast every day. 16/8 usually.
Not because I don't have money for food haha.
But because it provides many health benefits.
Could be a culprit, but I don't wanna leave it.
On my free days, it's not much of an issue.
But it's particularly sticking out with my life style.

4. My work could also be a culprit.
I work as a construction worker for about 10 hours a day, 6 days in a week.
It might sound pretty terrible, which partially it is.
But it's mostly a lot of walking and crouching rather then carrying heavy stuff. Sometimes the latter is the case but I'd eat more for those days.
So I dunno.

5. I also heavily limit my sugar intake.
I avoid refined and added sugars entirely.
Fruit is diverse but I don't eat too much.
I found that whenever I would eat more fruit I'd somehow get hungry again fairly soon.
So sometimes I use it as an appetizer.
I have no idea if this matters much, but that's what I personally noticed.

So yeah, other then all of that.
I have no clue. It's all organic, I make everything on my own. Even on cronometer everything is filled out.
Yet, despite being at 2500 calories pretty much each day.
I still feel slight hunger.

I hope you guys can help me out on this.
Thank you very much.",0

Learned how to fix that one after suffering for a few weeks.  It still does happen occasionally but it isn't as long-lasting and at least now I know what to do.

I still sometimes learn new things about the diet... and over time I've learned quite a bit about myself.  Today I fit into a size large loosely after living the 2X 3X life for so long.

I noticed this sub prides themselves on lack of oil so I had a few questions:,4,8hggaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/8hggaq/i_noticed_this_sub_prides_themselves_on_lack_of/,21,1525653997.0,"I myself mainly just have the question: What are the pros and cons to a diet without as much oil? And why use that diet versus a more oily one?

Then I have two other questions. When I bake vegetables, I usually coat them in oil. There are two main reasons I do this:

1. So they do not burn and stick to the pan.

2. To get more healthy fats in my diet. 

Point one: This is the main reason I use oil and the main thing I am trying to wrap my head around. If I put potatoes in the oven without oil they would surely burn into the pan and damage its structural integrity. I myself am an environmentalist so I cannot circumvent this by purchasing one-time use pans. Plus that still doesn't accomplish the primary issue of not using oil for this point which is potential waste. If I cook without oil, each bit of food that is burned to the pan has to ultimately go to waste which I am highly uncomfortable with. So my question is, if not using oil as a lubricant between the food and the pan, what else can I use?

So regarding point two: If I did not coat my veggies in oil my macronutrient ratio would be mostly carbs which is counterproductive and counterintuitive with my current goal in mind. I would need to get fat elsewhere. What are some other ways to get more fat in my diet? I do not mind doing shots of oil if it is somehow better than cooking oil with my veggies.",0

I DID THIS! It still doesn’t feel real!

Before I started my keto journey, I had  one goal in mind: I just wanna be skinny.

Fast forward to today... I’ve gotten so much more! 

Im healthy, I have energy, I stopped binge eating. I have SELF CONTROL. I save money by making and eating my own foods.. and save money because I don’t eat as much! 

And Who would’ve thought loosing weight would make it 100 times easier to exercise. I started exercising slowly at the beginning. At a public track i go to, I could barely jog one lap without stopping. Today, I can jog at least 5 laps 💪🏻

My before photo was taken maybe the first two weeks on keto. My after was taken yesterday.. and I’m wearing the same shorts!

I am 5'2, 23,F.

So I don't really have anyone to share this to, so I decided to share with all of you.  I'm a lurker on this sub, as well as xxketo and ketorecipes.

So, last year was my final year of University and I also got into a car accident in my supposed final semester. It wasn't too serious, I just had a concussion but that made me have to take another semester before I could graduate. 

Anyways, I basically slept a lot and just ate chocolate (because it is my comfort food and I love it) and also fast food. I had gained some unwelcomed weight during my studies (I was bouncing between 150 to 160 pounds a lot), and of course my weight gain went up with all that chocolate!

August 2019, the before pic, was my biggest weight. 176 pounds. I honestly couldn't believe it. I knew I had that freshman 15 to lose but now another 15-20 pounds on top of that?!?

So I started my weight loss journey in September (2019) and I am proud to say that as of today , I am 125!! (Smaller than my high school weight) 

I'm so happy and I'm looking forward to maintaining this body and toning :)

TLDR;  lost 50 pounds

EDIT: wow my first dick pic, is this what it's like to get hit on 😂

I've had friends that have had tremendous success with Keto, but I have a really hard time with it.

If I try to eat 1500 calories, which is what a 150 lb man is supposed to eat, then I find myself eating 375 calories (25% of daily calories) of protein (usually in the form of a plain hamburger), and one frozen bag of cauliflower, which puts me at about 16 g of carbs. 

I know that I'm supposed to have 25% of my calories from protein and I have to stay below 20 grams of carbs.

My problem is I basically have 1200 calories of fat to eat. And quite frankly it just doesn't fill me up. 

I can start off with a higher caloric count say 1700-1900, and over time whittle down to 1500, but fundamentally what am I supposed to do eat 1200 calories of butter?

I desperately want to get healthy and get rid of these excess pounds.

I can handle omad pretty well, but I don't know how to combat the hunger I feel if I eat 1500 calories of a strict Keto diet. I also have zero problem eating the same thing day after day after day. In fact I kind of like it.

I do weight lift and I am running roughly 6 miles at least four times a week.

Happy to answer any questions

Many thanks",1
I really feel like I’m breaking through plateaus with this diet/lifestyle change and a change in the way I workout.,29,euzhj1,https://i.redd.it/22d0wih90dd41.jpg,8,1580209329.0,,0
"I really want keto to work out for me, but...",1,wteat,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/wteat/i_really_want_keto_to_work_out_for_me_but/,28,1342734198.0,"Hi ketoers! 

**Tl;dr stalled and unhappy with available foods (routine-altering, avoid-all-cafes-and-restaurants levels of carb craving) but also have eliminated hypoglycemia. Argh!**

**edit** I am not dehydrating, I drink water pretty much constantly. I don't know how people are making the leap from ""I'm worried about dehydration"" turning it to ""I'm trying to dehydrate to lose water weight hurr durr."" I also take a multivitamin and get plenty of fiber, between good veggies and psyllium husk. I am never hungry and 1200 calories is fine and normal when you're this short; my nutritionist said it was fine too.  

So, keto was really, really good to me for the first two weeks. I dropped ten pounds in no time flat. Now I haven't lost a fraction of a pound since around July 4th. This is driving me nuts, especially since I am losing weight on a deadline -- I need to be as small as possible before I start work in September -- and because I've been able to lose 2 pounds a week using other (albeit more strenuous) diet and exercise plans. 

I've stayed at or under my calorie goal (1200/day, which allegedly puts me at -1.3/week, since MFP considers it unsafe to eat less), and my carbs have been impeccable at under 20/day the whole time.

The other frustrating thing about the stall and the whole diet in general is that I have not seen any extinction of carb cravings. I'm thinking about food more than usual, which is saying something. At any given moment I am most likely thinking about cupcakes or bread or croissants or fruit or pasta or... you get the idea. Carbs are usually my favorite foods, but allegedly keto is supposed to help get rid of those after the initial few days. Not so here. 

In the last week I got frustrated with my lack of weight loss so I've been hitting the gym for 400-800 calories of exercise every other day, and not topping up my net intake. Still nothing.

I have cut out all artificial sweeteners. Taking a packet of sweetener in my morning coffee had been a nice lifeline to carb-flavor craving abatement, so this is driving me a little more nuts. I have also stopped drinking Powerade Zero, which means I have to consume more salt, water, and other electrolytes through alternate means. I've been waking up in the morning so dehydrated that I can't even swallow. I'm not sure if I'm getting enough potassium and magnesium, but in any case underconsumption of those would cause me to dehydrate and therefore lose some water weight, so for the purposes of this discussion I'm going to ignore the issue. 

My boyfriend swears I'm looking smaller, but I don't quite trust his opinions for a few reasons. First, he is madly successful on keto so far, losing between half and 1 pound a day while not thinking about food and loving the diet in general. Second, keto has completely eliminated my hypoglycemia, which had been pretty severe to the point where I wouldn't risk driving without some snacks in the glove compartment, in case I had to pull over and eat to raise my blood sugar to functional, non-passing-out levels. Without the hypoglycemia I'm also much less of a bitch, so naturally boyfriend would prefer that I stick to keto. 

Honestly I'm also afraid of going off keto because the last thing I can afford is for my hypoglycemia to come back, but on the other hand I'm miserable and not even losing weight. If anyone else has gone through a similar constellation of symptoms -- perfect compliance, stalled weight loss, and massive constant carb cravings -- I would really appreciate hearing your input. 

Thanks.

[Before and After](https://imgur.com/gallery/rRrp44P)

I started keto in May of 2019. I was over 400 pounds at the time. I had a hard time doing a lot of very basic things. I got out of breath easily, and I was too big to fit in booths, standard chairs, and closed MRI machines. I became prediabetic and had alarmingly high blood pressure. I was afraid that I wasn't going to live long enough to see my four-year-old twins grow up. I felt hopeless and sank into a deep depression.

After some therapy to deal with the depression issues, I decided that I wanted to improve my life, and that meant getting my weight under control. I lurked here for a month or so, reading and re-reading the FAQ, researching keto, and getting inspired by all of the success stories here. So as I hit my first major milestone, I wanted to share my story with you as thanks.

My blood sugar, A1C, and blood pressure are now all back within normal ranges. I look better and feel healthier than I have in years. I can play outside with my kids! I still have a ways to go for my goal weight, but life is already so much better than I ever imagined it could be again.

If you're thinking of giving keto a try, go for it. Your health is worth fighting for. And for everyone in the middle of their journeys, keep strong and I hope you crush your goals in 2020!

So I just started strict Keto back up after using it to lose about 50lbs over the last 18 or so months. The goal is to lose 20 more by the end of Summer and be in very good shape. 

The above is a picture of tonight's dinner. It consisted of:

-5 Scrambled Extra Large Eggs(with at least a tblspoon of butter)

-4 Strips of Bacon
    
-3 Hamburgers(no bun) with 5 strips of bacon chopped up and put between two slices of Sharp Cheddar on each. Between the three burgers, the precooked ground beef weight was 1.8lbs.
 
-A large Protein Shake(not pictured) made with Unsweetened Almond Milk and two scoops of Chocolate Whey Protein and a scoop of natural Peanut Butter.

I'm combining Keto with 23-1 Intermittent Fasting, which I've found easier to do for my schedule and seems to have better results.  This is the only thing I will eat all day, and it went down very quickly after getting back from a 20 mile bike ride and gym session. I workout on an empty stomach in the afternoon each day toward the end of my fast, and have a great deal of energy.

Good luck everybody!",1

I swallow air.,1,9rw8xo,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9rw8xo/i_swallow_air/,11,1540691555.0,"This might sound crazy to most of you, but I made a discovery that I thought I would share in case anyone else here is in a similar situation...

&#x200B;

I've been really happy with my keto progress so far but have been trying to track down the cause of ongoing bloating. And after a few days of testing, I think I've figured it out: I subconsciously swallow air. Constantly. It's a nervous habit of mine, I suppose. I seem to swallow air most when drinking. All day I hydrate by using a plastic cup with a plastic straw. Switching to using no straw and being VERY slow and conscious of not letting any air be gulped down with the water **has dropped me 2 inches on my waist.** I also swallow air while eating (sometimes it is so much that it is VERY immediately painful and can only be helped by letting out a lot of gas - I have been aware of this for few years now) and I seem to just 'gulp' air/saliva when resting, too. 

&#x200B;

I switched from keto to WFPB for three weeks and my bad cholesterol dropped 71%,264,9bu5mq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/9bu5mq/i_switched_from_keto_to_wfpb_for_three_weeks_and/,98,1535755148.0,"Recently used my body as a guinea pig to compare the keto and WFPB diets and thought I'd share my n=1 experiment here!

My primary health goal has been weight/body fat loss this year. I was on keto for 4 months from April to July this year and had done it on and off for a couple years. Weight loss was good, but I started reading ""How Not to Die"", got concerned and took a blood test.

My LDL ""bad"" cholesterol came back high at 201 (optimal level is below 100). My HDL ""good"" cholesterol was also super high 71 (optimal is above 40) so based on the ratios, it wasn't life threatening but I decided to do an experiment and go whole food plant based. 

Did it for 3 weeks, switching from copious amounts of bacon, chicken, sausage, butter, and eggs, to oatmeal, fruit, beans, tofu, and brown rice. I ate lots of vegetables on both diets, but more on whole food plant based. Also used cooking oil on both. I know WFPB discourages added oils but I'm pretty reliant on stir fries for cooking. I retook the test this week and the results are pretty dramatic.

My LDL cholesterol dropped by 143 or 71%. Studies I looked at for 3 week experiments [like this] (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/615295) averaged 19-25% for men. Not even the most clickbait vegan blog post I've read has differences this significant in this short a time. My good cholesterol is now higher than my bad cholesterol, which I didn't know was possible. Kidney and thyroid numbers also look better. Blood pressure went from normal/pre-hypertensive (120/80) to optimal (95/65).

I would guess it's not common for a person to go from keto/high fat to vegan/whole food plant based, but these results are so out there I can't help but wonder if something was measured wrong. I'll retest in a couple months but in the meantime, I'll take it.

On both diets I've lost weight (down about 40 lbs since October of last year and down about 3-5 lbs this month and am in the healthy range for BMI and body fat) and had good energy levels (I usually play 5-15 hours of basketball a week) though I think I had slightly more on keto. I was intermittently fasting on both and skipping lunch most days as well. 

WFPB diet was also lighter on my wallet, and dropped my grocery bill about 30% since I was allowed to eat cheap calories like rice, beans, and pasta again. In this sense I think coming from another restrictive diet in keto made this a lot easier because I was so excited at being able to eat rice and fruits again.

I feel a popping or a sort of shifting sometimes on my left side when I’m not engaging my legs getting up. Mind you, I’m 6’5, and probably when I started Keto 515 or 520. Now this surgeon has never met me before. I told him of my family history of obesity. How I had been doing a ketogenic diet and that my clothes felt looser. Wasn’t sure how much, but a step in the right direction. He checks me and says he can’t find anything like a hernia. Awesome! And then proceeds to tell me about gastric bypass. Now great, he’s offering me help. Surgeon help. Not counselor help to see why I’ve been eating this way for 35 years. Not a nutritionist. He’s not my PCP so I guess he’s just trying to get paid too. But he said how much success bypass has been. I hadn’t Wright myself since my pre-surgery assessment. Then it was 490. A wake up call. But I was also about to go into major foot surgery. Surgery I’m still healing from. 

On one good leg, well 1.5, I asked if there was a scale that went over 500.  He sort of shrugged off the question and his med student helped me find it. I hesitantly stepped on the scale. 436.5 I’m lost around 75 pounds since I started a Ketogenic diet 3 months ago. Strict? Nah. Cheat days? I’m human. But did I go back? Every goddamn time. And with one good leg, a shitty foot, and determination, I lost 75 pounds in 3 months. Fuck.

Thank you very much for the Silver!! 🤩

Female, 5'8"", 175 pounds.

Hello everyone. I did the Keto diet 3 years ago based on my doctor recommendation, back then I was battling Insulin Resistance and taking metformin. I already reversed my IR years ago.

I want to point out something some of you might know already: you don't balloon back after doing Keto, unless you go back to your old bad habits. With Keto I learned new better habits that helps/helped to keep the IR and diabetes type II at bay. Everybody on my dad's side is diabetic, I have a heavy genetic load there...

I decided to jump on the Keto bandwagon after getting out of quarantine: I was 194 pounds. I already dropped 19 pounds, doing keto for the last 3 months, working out 3-5 times a week and doing intermittent fasting 18:6. I feel stronger, have mental clarity, sleep better, my A1C is 5.1 (last year was 5.5). This time I decided to do Keto for life. This is the way to a healthy life.

All in all, thank you for all the information and links and anecdotal posts about how this lifestyle changed your life, how your doctor's jaw drops when you bring you labs and they show you're healthier than ever. Thank you.

TL;DR: Thank you for all the information about this lifestyle.",1

So I wanted to try a extreme diet, a toss up between going carnivore and plant based. I decided to try plant based for a month, took me about a week to ease in then I fully committed. Everyday I ate an apple, banana, carrots, grapes, broccoli, LOTS of beans, quite a bit of nuts, Avocados, some different kinds of long grain rice, and the biggest thing for me, 12 OZ of straight beet Juice every day around 2pm. I felt the most change happen when I started on the juice. I kept a regular workout schedule, 4 times a week, no cardio, just weight lifting. Every night I got 6-8 hours of sleep, work and school most of the day, then relaxing. The only thing I would say wasn’t plant based in my diet is my preworkout, and protein drink, but those have been a part of my day for as long as I’ve been working out. The first night I went full plant based it started happening, just very long, vivid dreams. Not dreaming of food, just random things a 20 y/o nerdy guy could dream of. One dream it would be a zombie apocalypse, another a bank heist, or I’m on my way to space to save the planet. Very vivid, and I remembered them after I woke up. They where intense. No nightmares, but I must of had these vivid dreams 25/30 days on this diet. Anybody else experience this??? I want to figure out what it was that caused this so I can start doing it again, without going full plant based.",0

I started keto for the mental clarity and the energy.
My starting weight was 63Kg at 170CM (138lbs to 5’7).
I ended my keto in a month and lost about 5kg.
I stopped keto because I was traveling for months.
I did not watch the macro nutrient I was eating and I was just feeding myself eggs, cheese and cream.
I would fast 48 hours a week and eat OMAD. (600-800kcal)

It was until last few weeks ( late July) where I notice my hair has gotten thinner. 
I have a lot of hair to begin with and I might have been shedding around mid July but I did not notice it.
This is how much hair I lose every time I wash and dry my hair. [Here](https://ibb.co/D7hJyLj)
This has been on going for weeks and my doc diagnosed me with Telogen Effluvium.
Telefonica Effluvium happens when your body go into a shock which results in your hair “committing suicide”.


It took me a few days to feel better. There is no cure to this as the hair were already “dead”. 
Each hair falling off is a new hair growing.

My point  of this post is, please ensure you are getting macro nutrient and enough calories as a start so your body can slowly adapt it.

Happy Keto-ing.

Hi guys,

I'm teaching myself HTML/CSS/Javascript and tried my hand at turning an AHK script I wrote into a web app so that others could use it. [Here it is!](http://mylowcarbpantry.com/)

It uses [Linda's Low Carb Recipes](http://www.genaw.com/lowcarb/) (I wrote a script to scrape all the information from her site) and searches recipes based on keywords that you choose, as well as her ratings for her recipes.

Essentially, you can narrow down her recipes based on certain criteria. Hungry for chicken, or maybe you have some that's about to expire? This is the tool for you!

*It's important to note that my site links to her site. My site doesn't list ANY of the ingredients or directions, so you will still have to go to her site for more information! I don't want to take any traffic away from her, I only want to make it easier to access!*

I'm sure there's lots of bugs and things I didn't catch. Let me know of any improvements I can make! I intend to expand the database to include other sites as well, so hopefully you guys like it.

Thanks!


**Edit:** Forgot to mention: as some of you may notice, the recipes in the results are, frustratingly, not always in alphabetical order. If anyone knows how to sort an XML document by certain nodes, please PM me! I would do it by hand but it's about 6500 lines.

Nine months ago, I was 190 lbs with a 30+ BMI and a proud couch potato. Fast forward to today, I'm down 53 lbs thanks to keto, intermittent fasting, and strength training/cardio 5-6 days per week.

My gym had a contest where the top three people with the most workouts in the month of May won tickets to local sporting events. I'm naturally very competitive, so I made it my goal to be #1. Welp, I WON! The gym is in my office building, so I did hour-long lunch-time workouts every week day. I even came in on the weekends a few times to get extra points. I should also mention that I'm a mom with three young kids and a full-time job, so getting in 5-6 good workouts per week is a challenge. It was hard, but I did it and I'm not slowing down anytime soon!

If you would have told me nine months ago that I'd turn into the kind of person who gets grumpy when I can't lift heavy things for 30+ minutes per day, I wouldn't have believed you. If anyone is looking to add fitness into your keto journey, don't be discouraged if your progress is slow! You don't have to run 5+ miles per workout or do a million reps of strength exercises, just MOVE YOUR BODY. When I started, I could only run for 90 seconds at a time before I felt like dying. I very slowly increased my stamina over months of work, and now I can run two miles without stopping. If I can do it, you can do it! KCKO!",1

I'm in my early 20's and am very interested in transitioning to a vegan diet. I've heard all the anecdotes and studies of overweight and dying people going on a vegan diet who heal in a matter of weeks. I get the incentive for people who are dying to go on a vegan diet because it literally saves their lives. But from a solely health standpoint, why should someone like me go vegan? I'm fit and thin and eat a pretty healthy diverse diet (not currently vegan or vegetarian). I recently had blood work done and everything (yes, everything) is normal. I am healthy and I feel healthy. My family history is full of individuals who live to be 100 and there is no one I know of who has died of a heart attack, many of them being ranchers who raise cattle and eat a diet mostly comprised of beef and dairy. 

So, to put it blatantly, why should I give up foods that I love if the only benefits are having skin that's a little clearer and being less tired sometimes?

I'm a firm believer that anyone can lose weight, you just need to find something that works for you and stick to it. Sometimes it just takes a little determination and a little stubbornness because I'm just an ordinary guy that wanted to make a change, nothing special.

Commonly asked questions:

• SW: 545 at 25 yrs old, now I'm 220 at 28
• I'm 6'3
• I did atkins for about a year and a half, keto the rest
• I really don't go to the gym. I'll go for like a week, every 6 months but I need to in order to bulk up
• Yes there is loose skins. It's not the prettiest but it's there. Maybe one day I'll get it taken care of but paying and finishing school take priority 
• Yes my health was super shitty, it's much better now. Don't know of any permeate damage, but hopefully not. 

I really hope this post helps encourage someone that is wanting to start, has started and is having issues, or is a vet but had stalled. I can't tell you how many times I've stalled but I kept it going because I refused to give up. *Que stubbornness*. Like I've said, I'm just an ordinary guy.

I was overweight my whole life. Had crippling anxiety that made it difficult look anyone in the eye. My family and friendship relationships were constantly strained, my romantic life was nonexistent. I reached an all-time high for me at 260 lbs, I was starting to get stretch marks on my love handles and lower stomach and was revolted by myself in the mirror. I'd tried multiple diets, they never stuck. I'd heard of keto, but it always seemed this impossible lifestyle from the outside looking in. It took a full-blown panic attack, where I lost the ability to hear for a few minutes while presenting a simple little presentation in front of my law school class to look at myself honestly and take responsibility for the direction my life was going in. I decided to attempt what I thought was impossible. People say you should start off slow and steady, making incremental changes, but I was in such a radical mindset that in the same day I took on Keto, Intermittent Fasting, Cold Showers, 5k or weights 5 days a week, Ashwagandha, Probiotics. My goal weight was 220 lbs to get back to my stasis. To cut a long story short, for the first time I actually stuck to something and didn't quit. Not only did I reach my goal weight, I powered through and got down to my current weight of 180lbs. It took me 2 years with a couple plateaus, but finally got there.
My whole world has changed. Anxiety is gone, family relationships and friendships repaired, love life is healthy and it was all thanks to determination and this miracle lifestyle called keto + if. At 24, I feel like I've been born. 

To all those people unhappy with themselves and overweight considering attempting Keto + IF, YOU HAVE FOUND THE SOLUTION, look no further.

According to Michael Greger's book this cashew cream is a whole plant food and classified as a green light food whereas what it's replacing in Indian cuisine (heavy cream) is a red light food filled with all sorts of things that are bad for you. It just baffles me how the taste can be virtually identical but one is so much worse and the other so much better.

I'm flying for the first time in a long time. I've hated flying. I've always been incredibly uncomfortable and never fit in the seats. Buckling my seatbelt has always been a struggle and they usually have to offer me an extension.

But not so today! Not only do I fit in the seat without worry that I'm encroaching on my fellow passenger's space, I can buckle and have some belt left over!

I kind of slowly incorporated it, the first few days. Had increased gas etc but I mean thats to be expected. Yesterday the gas issues seemed to kind of start to slow down,  so i thought great , I can eat more now! And idk if i over did it or something else may be wrong. Yesterday I hit all (or most) of thr daily dozen , plus more. Everything was fine. I actually felt more energized/ awake and felt rly good. 

But then I woke up in the middle of night with rly bad pain.(about 7 hours after my last meal) It feels like my upper intestines are inflamed mixed with gas discomfort. Its dull but pretty damn painful. I just can't imagine that this is normal. Yesterday, I didnt have anything that I havent had before, I just ate a lot. Obiviously I know if this keeps reoccurring  that i need to see a doctor, but i wonder if anyone else has experienced this and what i should do for food today or if i should just stick with water.  I feel hungry because the inflammation doesn't feel like its coming from my stomach, but higher than that. 

This is what i ate yesterday incase someone sees a trigger. Like I said all of this stuff I've had before. Just not as much. 

Breakfast / morning
I made smoothie of kale,  spinach, a carrot, piece of cucumber, an apple, a stalk of celery,  handful of frozen pineapple, and a tablespoon of flax and Chia seeds. 

I ate like 3 or 4 superfood breakfast bites [has dates,walnuts,dried fruit, sunflower seeds, goji Berries,  chia and flax seeds]

Lunch
I had a sandwhich with Avocado,  tomato and spinach 

Dinner
I had two "" bowls"" with brown rice (cooked with veggies, tomato sauce and homemade veggie stock), black beans, and kale / spinach / mushroom on top with hot sauce.

I'm going in circles,3,6qmkpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/6qmkpp/im_going_in_circles/,18,1501510018.0,"Last week, I interviewed a cardiologist about diet and CV disease. I've since consumed vast quantities of podcasts, articles and videos from sites such as nutritionfacts.org. 

Now I'm going in circles looking at what foods have enough of element A but not too much of B, etc. I'm not hung up on being perfect on a daily basis, but over the course of a few days, I want to get adequate nutrition. 

Compounding the problem of me chasing my tail, is that I have an 11 year old son who wants to be plant based too. What I'm finding out is that his protein and essential nutrient needs are sometimes higher than mine.  For example, my research tells me I need 1000 mg of Calcium a day, but he needs 1300. Using cronometer, I see that I never meet my calcium needs. I do come close. For example, yesterday I hit 850mg, which I figure is good enough for me. But that means that he's not coming anywhere near his goal of 1300. And he eats less than I do. 

The doctor I interviewed was extremely concerned with people getting too much omega 6 in their diets, because that inflames the arteries. I've read up a lot on the subject and studies seem to confirm his concerns.  Now I'm finding out walnuts are off the charts on omega 6, as are a lot of other nuts. I had been pushing my son to take soy for the calcium and lysine content, but now have discovered it's high on omega 6 too. 

This all leads me to wonder if we should eat something like turkey breast once a week - just to ensure he's getting adequate lysine and other amino acids, and then I don't need to push high quantities of the high lysine foods that are crazy high in omega 6. 

Keep in mind, my philosophy has always been that your body will tell you what you need by making you crave a particular food. So again, I'm not hung up on perfection here. However, I also don't want to introduce some nutritional problems - esp regarding my son.

I've been lurking around the last few months picking up bits of knowledge and I think I have a unique experience that may help people.  A lot of people pick up keto for extreme health reasons; I picked it up because my weight was going to ruin my military career.  It ended up giving me so much more.

I've always been heavy despite intense dieting and exercise. After finishing my Basic Officer Course for the Army I was objectively fat due (270lbs) to weeks of eating MREs and panicked because I was given a slot to go to the Army Recon Course (ARC) with 8 Weeks notice. ARC is notorious for being crazy physically demanding and I was a to a point where I wouldn't be able to pass a PT test and there wasn't enough time to slim down and get in shape like I always had. I desperately buried myself in scientific studies on nutrition and found the Ketogenic diet.  It was basically the opposite of all the nutrition advice I had ever been given, so I met with a doctor to get my questions answered and schedule regular DEXA scans to track my progress. 

I ate roughly 2000 calories a day of amazing food and in 20 days I lost 15lbs (10lbs of fat, 5lbs of water) verified by the machine. By the time I reported to ARC I had lost another 5lb. I was also hitting PRs in the gym and felt phenomenal. I was a full believer by then, but I decided to stay on the diet throughout ARC and that was how I learned the true power of it. 

When I showed up to ARC I was still in bad shape compared to my Peers despite my progress. Our first field exercise was five 20hr days of rucking up and down ravines in the Georgia forests in full kit (80lb of gear and stuff). I ate pre-made keto meals at about 1200ish calories per day compared to my friends who ate MREs at about 3600 calories per day plus sugary snacks to keep them moving. Long story short, I completely outperformed them in ways I didn't think was possible. I had endless energy, no hunger, insanely fast muscle recovery, and extreme mental clarity when everyone else was droning out like brain damaged zombies. Everyone always talks about functional fitness; well this diet is a straight performance enhancer.  Anyone interested in combat fitness should try this cause it's just incredible.

Now I'm down to 225lbs, 22% body fat (army tapes me at 17%) and I just keep losing fat while getting stronger and more athletic. My goal weight is 200lbs and under 15% body fat by January 1st and I'm well on my way to achieving it.
I started Keto for the weight loss, but I'm going to stay on it for the athletic performance and overall health benefits.

He asked me to go, and I never say no to travel when asked - you just never know what kind of adventures you'll have. I ordered so many outfits from Asos my suitcase was almost too heavy to check (foreshadowing?). I remember getting on the plane, and the arm rests cutting into my legs the whole time. I remember I felt relieved that I could close the seatbelt, even though it barely made it. I felt ashamed and pulled the tray down in front of me and drowned my sorrows in chardonnay and a cheese plate.

When we got to LA, I unpacked my suitcase, and none of the outfits that I had bought fit me. I ended up wearing black jeans and a black tank top the entire trip. I got my weed card when I was there and did a lot of binge eating to try to escape my discomfort, which, as you know, only made me hate myself more. My bestie is an athlete who runs 13 miles everyday, and seeing him exercise on vacation made me feel like a toe thumb. To make matters worse, I was also in the closet back then, and met a random stranger to hook up with, which also made me feel like shit about myself even more.

I have since lost 65 pounds, have come out as bisexual to my entire family, all my friends, and at work, changed careers, am pioneering an LGBT community at work, and have been slowly but surely coming more and more out of my shell and letting new people get closer to me. I have a lot more work to do on myself inside and out. I want to lose some more weight, and tone up, but I am nearly at my goal of size ten jeans, which I was in high school.

I was at 348lbs before Carona and shot up to 368 2 months after lock down. 

I started feeling REALLY bad, no energy, my blood sugar was through the roof hardly left my bed for anything. I really wasn't eating THAT bad but I am now a believer that my body just cannot handle carbs. I've begun to look at it like an allergy; some people are allergic to nuts, or dairy my body is allergic to carbohydrates. Looking at it like CARBS = Sickness has given me a whole new view on things making it easier for me to stick to Keto.  

I saw my doctor yesterday on Day 33 of my Keto journey. My appointment was originally scheduled to increase my metformin because my body had stopped responding to it and it was no longer controlling my BG levels. 

Anyhow, my Dr. was shocked.  In roughly 1 month of Keto+ intermittent fasting and very light exercise (read just walking) I've lost 26lbs,  My A1C went from 10.8 (BAD) to 6.5 (Normal) my daily BG tests are between 98 and 120,  blood pressure is now normal, my feet and legs don't hurt as much and my sleep has improved I'm not pissing every 3 minutes I no longer feel like death and I feel like a different person. 

He asked me how I did it in such a short amount of time and was genuinely shocked that I had improved so much in such a short amount of time. 

Anyhow, instead of doubling my dose he cut my meds in half said if I keep losing by my next visit he will take me off them completely. It's surreal that this has all happened in a month. 

I went from feeling like death to feeling decent. (Not quite jubilant yet but I'm working on it! )

I've tried KETO in the past and I've lost weight but I never stuck with it long term. This time I am in it to win it. I honestly believe Humans were not designed to eat sugar and carbs everyday I don't care what anyone says, the LCHF diet is how we're supposed to be living.

Simple questions, small victories, basic requests that sit at 1-0 for 11 hours and get three replies. I've rationalised putting in that much time because I believe that this diet has the potential to have massive, lifelong effects on peoples health and longevity. 

To me, that's what keto is about. It's great seeing all those posts on the front page of people who've turned their lives around, but for me it's always been about the newcomer. The guy who didn't quite understand something in the FAQ, or the gal who was worried about heart palpitations and didn't realise it was a simple potassium deficiency. These are the people that I want to see get the most use out of the subreddit, the ones who are trying to get started on the path, not necessarily the ones trying to finish it.

The self-post only announcement didn't really bother me one way or another. What did was the reaction to it. There was some constructive criticism at first, but it quickly devolved into petty name calling, pitchforking, and flat out abuse. At the time of writing, the top post on the main page is an ""upvote if"" filled with vituperative snark and calls to unsubscribe.

No voice of reason.

No ""let's give it a week or two and see how it turns out, and then talk calmly and politely about switching back if the majority still don't like it.""

Just aggressive abuse, bullying, and ad hominem trash that I thought this subreddit was free from. It turns out that as soon as they don't get their way, keto-ers can be just as demeaning and cruel as the people they so frequently [rant] about.

I was going to wait another five pounds so I could do my 100 pound celebration, but today was just too awesome not to share. See, I fit into a pair of size 12 jeans for the first time in eight years.

In the first photo I was 232 lbs, 18 pounds shy of my eventual max of 250. The after is today about 60 seconds after I accidentally slipped right into a pair of size 12's. Today I weigh 155.

I bought them to tuck away into my bottom drawer as my 'one day' pants. When I got home and held them up I snorted. ""Oh, these are little girl pants! Maybe if I ever lose twenty pounds."" I just wanted to try them on to see how far I had to go. I haven't worn jeans since I grew past my size 22's years ago.

They slipped right up! I actually froze when they easily cleared my butt and hips. Paused for a moment, then tentatively tried to button them. They buttoned and zipped up like they were made for me.

Three minutes later I was sitting on the floor of my closet blubbering happy, snotty tears of joy into the phone with my daughter on the other end. She sent me this 'before' pic - that I'd totally forgotten existed - in response. ""Stop telling me you don't see a difference!!""

Before and After

I think I can safely say that I'm not fat anymore. I'm really not fat. Not even 'chubby'. I dare say, I think I actually look good! Everything from here on out is gravy.

I'll do a better write up and after photos when I hit the 100 pound mark and then I'll tell the story of how my body fell apart and how I found my way home again. But for today I'll just say...

I'M NOT FAT ANYMORE!!!",1

It's seriously fucking hopeless. This seriously makes me want to just take my fat ass to a cliff and jump. Why am I so whine-assy about this? And on top of it all, I'm a fucking shit person because I should just be happy for everyone and be motivated. Instead I want to take a pair of scissors and start cutting the fat and blown out skin off of my body. 

I guess I just don't get how MY body is THE WORST fucking shell out there. For other females in my same height and weight range, its un fucking believable how great they get to looking. I'm still the same old dog turd, just jostled around the lawn a little. 

And my husband is a prick about it too. He said don't compare yourself to others. How the shitting hell else am I going to know what I look like?  And I have a sneaking suspicion I'd still look like fuck even if I compared myself to some other animal anyway. 

Losing weight has meant great changes for everyone else it seems, and for me it's been empty. I still look like shit and I'm not convinced the next 75 pounds hold any promise.

I know this diet seems to be working very well for a lot of you, and I can certainly understand being excited about that. But the atmosphere in this subreddit sometimes makes me wonder if this is some kind of cult. 

I'm worried about starting this diet. It seems too good to be true. Can it really be healthy to pretty much eliminate an entire food group? Won't I be missing out on important nutrients by not eating fruit? I have so many concerns, but it seems pointless to ask these questions in this subreddit because I know I'll most likely get very biased responses.

I'm such a failure..,17,5g9mg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/5g9mg7/im_such_a_failure/,17,1480801706.0,"...at cheating! 
  Seriously, I have actually TRIED to find a cheat food. OK not like I'm going out there saying ""I'm gonna cheat today"" but we will go someplace for dinner and I see something I know I can't have. It drives me a little nuts so I figure, a bite won't hurt. 
  That's where it all goes horribly wrong.. but not like most people think.  I can't cheat! The stuff tastes HORRIBLE!  
  One of my favorite things used to be the chips and salsa (and queso!!) at mexican restaurants. Hubby and I would demolish a basket of chips and usually make a decent dent in a second one. We still go out for Mexican but either take Quest Tortilla chips or forego the chips and salsa all together. Thing is, they almost always still drop off a basket..no matter how many times you say ""no chips"".  At at least three different places I have tried to eat a chip and each time they tasted like old grease. 
  Then there's the yeast rolls at Texas Roadhouse. Used to eat those like they were candy.. I mean, c'mon.. they're covered in honey butter so why not? Last time we were there, we both took a bite from a roll and immediately said ""Ick! Too sweet!""  I couldn't even stomach the toasted one that came with my grilled shrimp.  
  Went to Hooters and had some naked wings. We went on a Wednesday cause they used to do unlimited wings then.. but it turns out that's Monday now and to get the unlimited special you have to get the ""combo"" that comes with fries. So hubby ordered that figuring if they brought them we'd just take them to the dogs. When the food came out, I snatched a fry and after one chew spit it back out! Old grease taste again.  Like it'd been sitting in it for hours.  
  I knew my tastes had changed.. I've been working my way up to liking mayo which I despised before. I crave eggs... where the only way I'd eat them previously was in an omelette that had something strong enough to mask the taste. But I think it's funny that all the stuff I thought I'd miss.. the things that I was afraid would sabotage me.. taste like utter crap when I've tried to eat them!
  This makes me wonder how people manage to have these ""Cheat Meals"" and ""Cheat Weekends"".. I just can't seem to do it! Such a failure. LOL",1

I've seen people post on here about their green poop, which came to a conclusion that it's their Mio, or people ate too many leafy green veggies, but me myself I've never had mio or anything blue for that matter. I've eaten spinach off and on within the past couple of weeks, but not to the point where it would dramatically turn my poop green.

Not much on the net either with regards to green stool and keto, but from what I read, it may have something to do with my body/bile is not being able to process the fat normal, and passes through my intestines too fast and out, resulting in green poop (bile is green). I read that could be not good. I go to the washroom for #2 once every two days since I've gone full time keto (two weeks ago per subject).

I'm looking to know how I can turn the green back to normal brown. I bought some emergen-c with probiotic plus and took a packet of that with water. I also bought some metamucil and some magnesium citrate. Hoping either one or all together would help my stool turn back to normal. I'm also thinking about eating more veggies to up the fiber intake.

Has anyone been in my situation? What have you've done to help yourself in this situation? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Just a tad bit concerned that's all.

Keto has left me with loose skin all over my body. It's left me struggling to eat out with friends. It's left me walking around grocery stores trying to avoid things that may cause me to gain weight.

But it has also left me 130 pounds lighter. It has left me with better blood pressure, lower cholesterol, and better blood sugar levels. It has left me with the ability to jog, the ability to do a sit up, and the ability to lift a weight. It has left me with a better understanding of healthy and unhealthy foods, as well as better knowledge of what my body needs. Sure, eating keto has taken me away from binge eating foods that comfort me, but keeping me away from those things is slowly going to save my life.

At 26 years old I sat at over 350 pounds. Each day I would go to get snacks or fast food, hide it in my purse, and sneak it into my room to binge eat at midnight. I would stay up late, just to make sure I got my fix, and I would eat until I was just about to be sick. I spent years of my life stuffing food into my mouth, even when I wasn't hungry, because it made me feel safe. Then the next day I would go weigh myself or look in the mirror only to despise what I saw and start the comforting process all over.

At 350 pounds, I would spend my life just trying to survive. I just wanted to get through the next day unnoticed. But today my outlook is a lot different.

Today, I want to be seen. Today, I look in the mirror and I see curves. I see a neck. I see something that I'm proud of. Yes, I struggle with my loose skin. It seems like after all I've been through and how hard I've worked, loose skin comes and robs that success because my body is still not ideal. I wish I had the flat tummy, toned arms, and thin legs. I wish I could rock shorts or a tank top or a crop top without being worried about how my body looks. But that will come with time. One day I may be able to save up enough for skin removal surgery, but for now, I try to remind myself that I am significantly healthier than I was last year, and that gets me through.

Keto seemed like a fad diet that was going to make me hate myself all over again, but instead, it was something that saved my life. I woke up every morning wondering when I would have my first heart attack, but now I wake up wondering when I'll run my first 5K. It's such an incredible mental change when you're focused on health rather than survival.

Today I'm thriving, and I'm so excited to make a post when I hit my one year mark on March 25th.Here's to hoping I'll have more amazing results to post.",1

I started at 433 pounds on Jan 1st 2019. Today my scale read 250.4. I used the keto calculator on this subreddit from day 1 and refreshed it about once a month for new macros.

I've officially been un-diagnosed with binge eating disorder.,1781,86smg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/86smg6/ive_officially_been_undiagnosed_with_binge_eating/,104,1521922064.0,"My therapist told me my eating habits no longer qualify me as a binge eater and that I now fall into a ""chronic overeater"" category due to anxiety. Instead of working on improving my binges (which aren't binges anymore!), we're working on ways to better manage my anxiety so that the overeating happens less frequently (about once a week right now). I broke down in tears in her office yesterday, it just felt so liberating to officially be ""cleared"" from being a binge eater. Her and I agree, the switch to Keto played a huge part in the whole thing because I am no longer eating the foods that would have originally triggered me to binge.

I thought this was something I would have to deal with for the rest of my life, but I feel as if I'm finally free of my emotional tie to food. (Edit: I worded this poorly. What I meant was having someone tell me that my eating habits no longer qualified me as someone who suffered from binge eating disorder made me feel free from the Black Cloud that is BED and has been hovering over my head for quite some time. I would feel guilty every time I took an extra spoonful of peanut butter out of the jar and ate it and every time I had a piece of candy because the BED that had consumed my life for so long told me that if I ate that stuff, it was bad and I was bad. My therapist broke down my last several “binges” and what I ate and she said to me “Just because you eat more than you should sometimes doesn’t qualify you as a binge eater anymore.” So to me, that is emotional freedom not from the food, but from the BED.)

EDIT: For those of you asking, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/86smg6/ive_officially_been_undiagnosed_with_binge_eating/dw7w6zt/) is the eating habits I was dealing with that originally got me my BED diagnosis. My most recent overeating sessions have stayed well under 4,000 calories at their worst (but that is absolute worst, usually now it's like eating a total of 2,000 calories in a day). No, I'm not diagnosed with ""overeating while stressed"" I'm diagnosed with anxiety right now and we are hoping to resolve it without any medication. Everyone copes with anxiety different. Some people don't sleep, some have panic attacks, some physically harm themselves, I overeat and by treating my anxiety and finding ways for me to cope with it, it should help reduce the amount of overeating that I do.

I also noticed a lot of people writing and saying that it's something that they're struggling with as well, I'd just like to put out there that my therapist gave me [this](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/the-dialectical-behavior-therapy-skills-workbook-matthew-mckay/1008150072/2679449628496?st=PLA&sid=BNB_DRS_New+Marketplace+Shopping+Textbooks_00000000&2sid=Google_&sourceId=PLGoP164997&gclid=CjwKCAjw7tfVBRB0EiwAiSYGM6R-ME0VJ6Cd3vdgcVjroPeAmVXp6uA_joAfbsecLtRXqA8s5KIv3xoCi18QAvD_BwE) book and we have been working through it and talking about different coping mechanisms together to help me to regulate and better handle the overwhelming emotions I deal with when anxiety strikes that is not overeating.",1

I posted [the same thing there](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/dpt7hx/ive_recently_been_diagnose_with_nonalcoholic/) hoping to find some good resources. I was hoping to get links to serious talks, detailed science based blog posts, studies, etc..., preferably specifically about fatty liver. Instead I got some comments and a few documentaries about veganism in general. One of the top rated commenters did warn me that /r/vegan was mostly interested in animal rights, not nutrition.



....



Background




....





My doctor, who is a vegan, recently diagnosed me with fatty liver disease, and suggested I stop eating all animal fats. She recommended that I cut out almost all meats and dairy and eat a lot of fibrous vegetable/plant carbs (beets, green beans, fruit, etc...). -> basically a low animal fat, medium carb diet




A different medical professional, from a different country, suggested the complete opposite. This medical professional suggested I adopt a keto diet with a lot of fats, medium protein, and absolutely no carbs at all.




Anecdotally in terms of my own experience, I know a lot of people who have had success with keto, but not for this condition. I don't personally know any vegans, except for one of my best friends who was extremely unhealthy. I am willing to give veganism a good try, but am generally biased in favor of the keto option.




The worst seems like a high carb, high animal fat diet, which is what I ate before. I've also read that a low carb and low fat diet is very dangerous. The more I research, the less sure I am of what to do.






After a few days of low animal fat and low carb, I don't think I can do vegan and keto at the same time. I just hate the taste of both olives and avocados, and both make me feel sick to my stomach.




I probably could sustain a carbs + vegan diet with only a few difficulties, and I definitely sustain a high fat keto diet.



....





Completely disregarding any moral considerations about animal rights, and also disregarding any other health benefits that veganism might have unrelated to fatty liver, what is the best evidence for a vegan diet to treat fatty liver?




What are the best talks, studies, books, articles etc... (preferably specifically pertaining to fatty liver)",0

Then I looked and the same had been done for many other websites and blogs that are commonly referred to on /r/keto.

In case it gets taken down, here is a cap of the current frontpage:

This HAS to stop. I put a lot of effort into my site with putting pictures of how to cook stuff along with instructions and nutritional info. It really hurts when this hard work is lifted and repasted without credit.

To be clear I have no problems with people posting links to my site with the recipes, only copying it directly without a link.  I think /r/ketorecipes is a good idea but it can't be run like this.  This was one of the things that scared me about a splinter cell of ketoers is that there would be less moderation and something like this could start to happen.

If you've ever been to my site or liked one of the recipes, please help me somehow stop this from happening.

So if this had happened, I would have surely died. Not even broad spectrum antibiotics would have saved me in time.

The doctors wanted me to start on 10 units of insulin per day immediately. I decided to do my own research, which was arguably not a smart thing to do considering my previous diet and my hesitation to go the ER, to try to tough it out. But I had read this sub and r/ketoscience before this happened and decided to keep reading.

I had a silver dollar sized hole on the back of my neck.

I had a fist sized hole in my back.

They healed weeks earlier than anyone predicted. 

-----

My followup wound care doctor credited my ""miraculous"" recovery to the diet change, though he was concerned with the amount of fat and protein I was eating.

I've long since stopped having the massive protein cravings and have gotten my macros dialed in. 

-----

My blood sugar high while in the hospital was 400. I didn't know I was diabetic yet (though I'm pretty sure subconsciously I knew) and I had ordered the juice tray because I didn't feel like eating. But I was surely a sugar addict and didn't know it/acknowledge it. 

After that, they restricted me to the diabetic menu. I ate omelettes and bacon from them on. Something told me not to eat carbs. I won't say it was anything supernatural—most likely it was some subconscious part of me realizing that all the sugar I had eaten up  to that point was destructive. 

And luckily I did understand even then that all carbs were sugar at the end of the day. So right then and there I cut that shit out. 

-----

I remember asking the dietician they brought in about keto and intermittent fasting, and she basically told me to just take my insulin and eat 3 meals of mostly carb a day.  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

This is also what the literature they gave me said to do. 



-----

Once I left the hospital, they had me on intravenous antibiotics for two weeks via PICC line. Then Keflex for two weeks because they weren't sure my immune system would bounce back. If even a few of the bacteria survived and my immune system couldn't handle it, I'd be back where I started. 

That's how close it came. 

**Do not wait to make changes you know you need to make.**

**Oh, and I'm only 33. So don't think it can't happen to you yet.** 

My aunt has it, and it runs in my grandmother's family, so genetics plays a role. But still, don't roll dice. 

Don't be like me.

-----

Now, eight months later, I've lost 50 lbs, my A1C is down from 10 to 5, my blood pressure is normal and my cholesterol profile is loads better.

I only started exercising recently, so the change is 100% due to my change in diet. 

I require no insulin and no meds.

You can do it.

2nd day: Had a bullet proof coffee, one avocado 3 slices of bacon and eggs. Also, I had a pretty good back workout. 

3rd morning : Woke up had to run errands immediately and came back and tested and was positive.

Dammit, I cannot reach my feet.  So, no socks.  Tying my shoes.  Putting them on the floor.  Wedging my feet inside my shoes.  Sweat rolling down my face simply from getting dressed.  Exhausted.  Calling my friends.  Telling them I am sick and will not make it to their Memorial Day BBQ.  Not really sick, but too embarrassed to see my old friends.  Too fat to put on socks.  Pants that don't fit right.  Shirts that I have to continually fight to keep myself covered.  Afterwards, sitting in my apartment.  
     
Today.  Earbuds in my ears.  Pandora's ""Classic Rock Power Workout"" on full volume.  ""Welcome to the Jungle"" by Guns N' Roses blaring.  Straining on bench press rep number 6.  Holy shit, I still have two more to do.  Fighting through the fatigue.  Not able to complete the eighth rep.  Sitting on the edge of the bench.  Head down.  Sweat rolling down my face.  Dripping off the tip of my nose onto the floor.  Exhausted.  Not sure how I will get up and walk back to my car.  And I have never felt more alive.       
          
Three years ago.  Alone in my apartment.  Feeling sorry for myself.  Telling myself that I can't do anything to REALLY make effective change in life.  Feeling sorry for myself.  Useless.  Hopeless.      
     
Today.  I put my earbuds in again.  ""Peace of Mind"" by Boston playing at full volume.  Start walking.  It's hot.  It's humid.  The smell of fresh cut grass in the air.  U.S. flags planted in front yards.  Waving to my neighbors.  My shirt drenched in sweat.  Sweat rolling down my face.  And I have NEVER felt more alive.            
         
I welcome the sweat because my sweat washes away my hopelessness.  I welcome the fatigue because my fatigue bears me strength.  From the sweat and fatigue I am reborn.  Awaking each and every day anew.  Empowered with the ability to make effective change to my life.         
      
The Brian from three years ago has passed.  No longer walking this earth.  No longer trapped by his fat.  No longer hopeless.  Today, I lay him to rest.  Say goodbye to him.  I carry on my body too many reminders of him, and therefore, no need to lay flowers on his grave to honor him.  I honor him by turning around and walking to my new me.      
       
I honor him by pushing myself to complete that eighth rep on bench press.  I honor him by walking a little faster.  I honor him by making sure that I NEVER feel hopeless again.  My sweat and fatigue will always honor him as it makes me stronger.  My sweat and fatigue honoring him by allowing me to dream.

I have searched and read all the FAQs.. And have posted this in ketoscience..

I am 43 years old / 9%BF / IF (24H + 16/8) / 177 tall / 67KG 

I am in good shape. I box and train my power/muscles 2-4 times a week.

I have just completed 12 weeks of keto diet and was quite clearly adapted around 8-9 weeks where i suddenly could do HI boxing again..

I did this as an experiment to see what it felt like and to try and import some elements into my life.
I think prior to this experiment I was allready often in ketosis with IF a couple of days a week.

I don’t think i will continue KETO a 100% of the time as it is too restrictive for my taste.
I dont want to loose weight (I don’t diet. I try to go for long term life changes)

So now I am searching for info about bouncing in and out of ketosis. All I can find on these subreddits talk about how you should not “cheat” and that you have to stay in ketosis all the time to reap the benefits..

I disagree as, from my understanding, it was the normal state for human beings (way back) to switch in and out. And as long as your healthy and adapted it shouldn’t pose a problem. Right? 

Any info, links or posts you can point me in the direction off would be highly appreciated.

Thanks again everyone for your time

Peder

Note: please spare me the comments about how i should not cheat and how I should stay away from the enemy of carbs.
I am not looking for an excuse to chug cake all the time. I am looking for some scientific info about intermittent keto. Thanks..

In case you need to hear this today...weightloss is not a straight line,1375,hvv37w,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/hvv37w/in_case_you_need_to_hear_this_todayweightloss_is/,94,1595458110.0,"Hi Keto Fam!!

If anyone needs to hear this today....weightloss is not a straight line!  Or, as some would say....weight loss is not linear!  I am one of those people that like to see patterns and data, so I weigh myself every day (mostly), as soon as I get up and after I go to the washroom. 

For proof of this weight loss truth, please have a peek at my weight loss graph....I started on April 14, 2020 at 208.9 lb...today I am 188.3 lb.  So if I average that out over 14 weeks, it's about 1.5 lbs a week.

But, if you notice, there are bunches of times that my weight jumped up a couple lbs, or dropped a couple lbs overnight.  There were also times my weight barely changed in a week.  

And this is the message of my post today!  Sudden weight changes, or lack of weight changes are often due to changes, or lack thereof, in water retention...so don't freak out!  Just KCKO! 

As long as the trend is downward you are doing it right!!  Track and weigh your food, take measurements, and you will have more than just the scale to measure your success by!

In response to Michael Greger's video series on aresnic in rice.,13,6smrwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/6smrwu/in_response_to_michael_gregers_video_series_on/,23,1502326252.0,"I am borrowing from some of the more intelligent and level-headed comments (which I agree with) below the most recent video, ""How much arsenic in rice is too much?"": https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-much-arsenic-in-rice-is-too-much/. In which he ends up recommending to totally minimize rice consumption to at most 1-2 servings per week, if anything.
_________________________________________

""Well one of the reasons that you may not see a bunch of Asians dropping dead from eating rice is that Dr. G said that the risk of getting cancer was about 1 in 300 from eating rice with some frequency. That means that there is a 99.67% chance of not getting cancer from eating rice alone. Yet over a third to 1/2 of people will get cancer in their lifetime presumably from other causes . So how would one even expect to see increased cancer in Asians from looking at the raw data. Even if you eat rice with every meal the risk is probably still not real high.

I find the hysteria here about eating rice to be silly. I have really enjoyed this series on arsenic in rice. I look forward to hearing Dr. Gs final conclusions. I eat rice a few times a week and I’m not too worried. All this means is that we shouldn’t eat too much of any one thing. The dose makes the poison.""

__________________________________________

""Let’s not get too hysterical. Here is a study that addresses directly the cancer risk for high rice eaters. Result: no significant association

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26219234""

_________________________________________________

""It’s really unfortunate that Dr. Greger is resorting to the same tactics as the keto/paleo/meatard crowd by literally resorting to n=1 worst case scenarios (the case of the celiac individual who ended up with arsenic poisoning).

I guess I received the answer to my question posted under the last video. Does Dr. Greger care to explain why the countries with the highest level of rice consumption have the lowest overall incidence of cancer, and vice versa? Clearly the answer is no, judging from his continued refusal to address it.

As previously noted, there’s obviously more to it than “Well, As increases cancer risk. There’s As in rice. Therefore, rice increases cancer risk.” Those countries where rice comprises the bulk of caloric intake (as previously mentioned, some of the countries with high rice consumption and low cancer incidence consume the equivalent of 16 servings A DAY), have limited access to, and therefore consumption of, more calorically dense foods like meat and dairy. Therefore they’re more likely to consume a lot more veggies and legumes with their rice.

A fact Dr. Greger has glanced over in this series is that Asians, who tend to consume 10-20 times as much rice as Europeans / North Americans, tend to have much higher As concentrations in their urine, yet still have much lower overall incidence of cancer. Clearly their bodies are excreting the excess As. Could it be what they’re consuming with their rice? We don’t know, because Dr. Greger refuses to address the question.

If we’re going to use the rationale that we shouldn’t eat anything that contains things that might be harmful, then may as well eliminate apples and potatoes (since they’re also high in arsenic), spinach, beet greens and almonds (high in oxalates), aubergine, sweet peppers and tomatoes (high in glycoalkaloid solanine), and the list can go on.

Again, the way this series has been constructed does a disservice to promoting a plant-based diet. That’s not just my personal opinion, but one quietly shared by other doctors promoting a plant-based diet.""

_______________________________________

**TL;DR: The added risk is unlikely to change your life outcome or cause of death, since your risk for other cancers will certainly be higher. When I start hearing about arsenic-caused cancer becomming a top-ten cause of death, I won't worry about it one bit, and I'll enjoy plenty of brown rice.**

"In theory, is there any diet that would allow you to NOT brush your teeth?",8,9vavaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/9vavaa/in_theory_is_there_any_diet_that_would_allow_you/,36,1541719249.0,"Studies seem to suggest that no matter what, you have to brush your teeth with something, even if it’s just baking soda, because otherwise, eventually, even raw fruit will give you cavities.
https://nutritionfacts.org/2013/07/25/do-vegans-get-more-cavities/   
*(Personally, I’ve found that I have to use fluoride toothpaste. I tried the fluoride-free stuff and ended up with two cavities after several months. As long as I stay on the fluoride toothpaste and vegan diet, I never get a cavity. I used to occasionally get cavities when I wasn’t vegan, even though I was using the same fluoride toothpaste.)*

This really bothers me. Are the reports of ancient peoples’ with perfect, straight teeth all false? I know that they sometimes used a stick to clean teeth, but that’s really more like a toothpick than a toothbrush and toothpaste. Unless most ancient peoples’ were using stuff like baking soda and we just don’t know that they were? It still bothers me that the body isn’t capable of keeping itself in working order, just like the animals. Yes, yes, I’ve heard the excuses that humans died sooner and therefore teeth lasting a long time didn’t matter, but that still sits wrong with me. If the body is capable of living to a certain age (as long as it isn’t killed off by external forces), you would think **every part** of the body is also capable of lasting that long. I would only expect tooth problems near the very, very end of life in extreme old age, since at that point everything in the body is breaking down because of old age. Instead we have the immediate cavity problems we see, even for vegans or raw vegans.    Technically, ancient peoples’ can just bathe in a stream and be fine. They don’t need soap or shampoo etc. They probably won’t look pretty or smell too great, but being a little filthy isn’t hurting them. In comparison, why are our teeth so fragile? All other species of animal have a natural way of keeping their teeth healthy, except us. WTF?

Is it just the raw fruit that does this? In theory, if we lived on lots of vegetables, beans, and potatoes would our teeth be safe from cavities? Or just greens and beans, if you think other things are also too dangerous like fruit?

I see things like soap, shampoo, female hygiene products, clothing, deodorant, etc as modern-day conveniences since we don’t all live in a tropical jungle with no man-made pollution..... as well as the norms of society to be squeaky-clean and smell nice at all times. Toothpaste is the only thing that seems to be seriously necessary for health, since your teeth will rot and fall out without it (long before you die of old age) and that really really bothers me, that in this one particular area the body seems utterly incapable of keeping itself healthy, even after you’ve provided it with plant food, water, sunshine, and rest.

Increased heart rate on WFPB,0,a9n2fu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/a9n2fu/increased_heart_rate_on_wfpb/,13,1545843449.0,"TL;DR: My heart rate increased on SOS-free WFPB diet and I don't know why.

I started exercising vigorously (strength training and HIIT) before going WFPB and just before my dietary change my resting heart rate was around 40-45. That actually felt really nice and relaxing because for some reason my heart rate strongly affects my mood, not just the other way round. It stresses me out when my heart beats fast although I should be relaxed (e.g. when life's *not* stressful and everything else is nice and I'm just sitting around or trying to sleep) and I get all calm and happy when it's slow.

A couple of months after going SOS-free WFPB I experienced a slow but steady increase in heart rate although I did not exercise less. My resting heart rate is now about 55; if I'm out and about it can climb to 70 even if I'm not doing anything strenuous.

How come? Has anyone experienced anything alike? Might this be because of a drop in blood pressure due to exercise and/or my salt-free diet? I've heard change in blood pressure may be inversely related to change in heart rate. Unfortunately, I have no data about my blood pressure back then and now…

Thanks for sharing your opinion and/or experience!

Instant Pot is a game changer,17,jfwpdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jfwpdg/instant_pot_is_a_game_changer/,14,1603389152.0,"I received an Instant Pot last Christmas from my parents. I wasn’t doing Keto then, but I am now. I was super hungry but didn’t feel like cooking so decided to try something. 

Unfortunately I’m bad about never measuring when cooking (a curse that all women in my family have lol) so I will have to measure next time I do this and post it to r/ketorecipes. So here’s a very **generic recipe**. 

• bag of frozen riced cauliflower (Aldi)    
• 3-4 frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts (Walmart)    
• mushroom broth (Aldi?) - maybe 3 cups? Just dumped lol    
• 2 sliced fresh jalapeños    
• 1/3ish of a white onion, sliced    
• goat cheese (Costco) ~1/4 of a log    
• seasonings: cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, lite salt, oregano, and chicken seasoning (just was liberal with all these)

I simply tossed all that into the pot and cooked it at high pressure for 15 minutes then shredded the chicken. It’s kind of soupy and amazing. I slapped a good portion of Daisy sour cream in the bowl and it was sooo good. Really nice to sit and wait for a great meal and not stand at a stove!!

I also swear by my air fryer so if you don’t have that get it!! 

Since this is a Mexican flair soup thing I made when I’m down to mostly broth I’m going to see how it tastes to dip pork rinds in it!

"Insulin resistance, diabetes, fatty liver and Keto in a scientific way",5,j6z9vm,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/j6z9vm/insulin_resistance_diabetes_fatty_liver_and_keto/,20,1602133062.0,"Whenever you eat, blood glucose level goes up. How much it goes up depends on what you just ate. Sugar will spike your glucose the most, then carbs, then most fruits, then most vegetable, and at the lower levels are fatty meats and others. Your body detects the rise in blood glucose and send signals to the pancreas to secrete insulin.  
  
Let's say that in a normal person, the blood glucose goes up by one (arbitrary units), the pancreas will respond by rising your insulin level by one. That will lower your blood glucose, then the insulin will slowly decrease.  
 In a type one diabete, your BG (Blood Glucose) goes up by one, your pancreas can't produce enough and will just create a 0.6 insulin rise, not enough to correctly lower BG. That's why insulin supplement are necessary.  
On the road to a type 2 diabete, BG goes up by one, pancreas will need to secrete 1.2 insulin to correctly lower BG, that's the start of insulin resistance.  
  
Insulin is a hormone that have two main goal, first is authorize your cells to access all the nutriments and glucose that you ingested to be consumed. If there is still glucose and nutriments, the second role is to send the rest to the liver to be converted to lipids cells. Insulin resistance is when you had too much BG spike, forcing your pancreas to secrete a lot of insulin. After a while (can take months or years) your cells start to become less responsible to insulin. Your cells will have trouble to ""open up"" and start to get nourished, so they continue to send message that they are starving until the pancreas send enough insulin. That's why people with some form of insulin resistance (all overweight and obese people, even if you don't need to be overweight to be IR) are hungry all the time, it is not just gluttony, their cells are really starving.  
  
After a while on the road to T2D, your BG will goes up by one and your pancreas will have to secrete up to 5x the normal insulin response to lower your BG! Understand that at this point, your fasting BG is still normal, but now, your pancreas is secreting as much as it can and if your BG continue to rise a lot after a meal, not enough insulin can be secreted, so fasting BG will goes up. Your are now prediabetic. Your cells are starving so you are starving. Role one of insulin is almost inhibited. Everything you eat is directly transformed to lipids cells, fats are already accumulated around and in your organs. You already have a fatty liver, which increase insulin resistance, and fatty pancreas, which lower you insulin production. You are T2D. If you get a blood test, your doctor might take you on insulin to lower your BG. But doing that will make your IR worse, so you will need more and more insulin until there is nothing more to do, with organs failing and deaths.  
  
Keto can be seen in different way. A good way to see is to prioritize food who rank very low in the Glycemic Index (a list you can consult where aliments are ranked on how much eating it will increase your BG, at the highest, 100, is glucose, just a bit lower is white bread, lower is pasta, then rice etc....). By reducing the spiking in BG after a meal, the need of insulin goes down, your pancreas don't have to work so hard. By reducing the production in insulin, after a while, the resistance of cells to insulin goes down (like if you were a regular drinker and stopped for a bit, then you drink again, you will feel a buzz you didn't feel before, because your resistance to alcohol got down). if your IR goes down, your cells now have easy access to nutriments, so your hunger goes down. With a lower insulin, another hormone take the lead, glucagon. While insulin stock glucose as fat, glucagon use your fat to regulate your BG to not have it goes too low. That's why you don't die with hypoglycemia if you water fast. If your insulin is high, glucagon is completely inhibited. By producing glucagon, the liver will consume the fat in and around it, reversing the fatty liver, same with the pancreas and other organs, improving IR and insulin production even more.  
  
Some symptoms of IR are: a need to drink all the times, skin tags, pee at night, carbs craving, hunger all the times and others.  
  
So, Keto is a good way to reduce IR. Other things can be used to accelerate the process. Exercising, obviously. Intermitent fasting. NOT HAVING SNACKS: eat 3 meals a day, not 3 meal + 4 snacks. If you can go lower and eat 2 meals a day, that's even better. Then one.

"Insulin, the only Keto god.",5,64xuvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/64xuvo/insulin_the_only_keto_god/,25,1492029266.0,"There is a lot of armchair physics going on, but I think this can be settled simply (yeah right).

Ketosis is a state in which the body uses stored fat for energy, it is the goal of the Keto diet and why we are here. What is the first rule, the one above all others? Keep carbs below your threshold, <20g to be safe. Why? Because any more than your threshold and you spike your insulin which closes off your fat stores and kicks you out of Ketosis.

But I only ate 500 calories yesterday! Don't care, not in Ketosis.  
I ate 5,000 calories but went over my carb limit. Not in Ketosis.

Someone fat adapted will burn more stored body fat in a day than someone who went over their limit, who will burn more carbs and protein while waiting for insulin to go down. People like me, and many of us here are resistant to insulin, that means we burn a LOT of muscle waiting for it to go down.

If you are fat adapted and on a Keto diet, that can ONLY happen if you keep insulin down. You are in ketosis if you do, and you aren't if you don't, calories have nothing to do with it at all.

You can debate what happens next, but there is no debate that insulin is what makes you Keto or not.

Is 10% fat enough for proper hormone regulation?,3,7pc4nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/7pc4nd/is_10_fat_enough_for_proper_hormone_regulation/,19,1515577045.0,"The other health community I participate in is weight lifting related, and the commonly used fat target is .4 grams per lb of bodyweight (or a target weight if overweight by a lot). For me that would mean 70 grams of fat, 630 fat calories, and about 20% of my calorie total. We use that target even during weight loss periods because going below it is considered dangerous for health.

I see a lot of you guys don't abide by this fat target. Most of the WFPB diet is carb heavy, and many seem content with something close to 80/10/10 carbs to protein and fat intake. For someone eating 2,000 calories a day, that means 200 calories, or 22.2 grams of fat per day. 

To me that seems like a dangerously low amount. Fats have many important functions in the body. They regulate hormones; low fat intake kills sex drive for example. Fats are needed for cellular functioning especially for nerve and brain cells. Many vitamins also need fat to absorb correctly (admittedly 5g per meal is probably enough for the later point).

For those of you comfortable eating 10% of your calories as fat, can you justify your intake level with something more than ""it's what's found in nature?"" Are you confident that 10% fat is truly sufficient for the body to function at its best?",0

Is Vitamin B12 evidence that humans are meant to eat meat?,14,apvdes,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/apvdes/is_vitamin_b12_evidence_that_humans_are_meant_to/,73,1550019158.0,"I first want to say that I am devoted to WFPB eating. It seems like the most research-backed diet, and has revolutionized my health and the health of many others. I am not looking to prove or disprove anything; only gain knowledge.

However, I was on /r/nutrition and some discussion there opened my eyes to the reality of Vitamin B12. Most vegans claim that B12 used to be abundant in water and soil (and feces), where it was made by bacteria. However, no study has shown that to be the case -- they show that you would need to consume an absurd amount of seawater or dirt in order to get enough B12. Second, the algae-produced B12, pseudocobalamin, might not even be usable by humans. The only study even remotely suggesting that there was enough B12 in pond water is from the 1950's before pseudocobalamin was discovered.

Of course, there's also the fact that animals typically are supplemented. Ruminants often need to be supplemented with cobalt since the soil is deficient. Pigs and poultry often need cobalamin supplements too. Humans can indeed get B12 from animals since their guts have bacteria which produce B12, and some say we needed to eat animals since we could never get B12 from our own guts or from soil/water bacteria. 

I know this doesn't say we *need* meat, but it does run contrary to the assumption that humans could survive naturally without meat (meaning no synthetic supplements). Even then, it doesn't meant we need to eat meat *today*.

So what's the deal here? Any interesting thoughts, perspectives, or research to share?

Is immediate weight loss normal?,0,4ze6z9,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/4ze6z9/is_immediate_weight_loss_normal/,8,1472094215.0,"Hi everyone! 

I'm a 5'2, 21 year old female and I've been on a very low fat diet for about eight months. A mixture of that plus exercise has helped me go from 145 to 115 pounds! I've been working out while still doing my normal diet, and for the most part I was staying 115. I don't have a problem with that because I'm happy with my weight, and just trying to build some muscle and lose some fat. 

Anyways, I learned of the keto diet recently and decided to give it a try to I can dump that extra fat and keep my muscle. So this is my fifth day doing keto, and it's been an extremely tough transition (going from very low fat to extreme fat). 

As of right now, I've already lost three pounds. Now that may seem good or maybe normal for someone who has more weight to lose, but I'm not that big. I haven't lost any weight for about two months (since I've been working out frequently to build muscle). Should this weight loss concern me? Is it normal? 

Before keto, I was eating around 1200-1500 calories a day, and that's what I'm doing on keto. Should I bump up my calorie intake or is this sudden weight loss supposed to be a good thing? 

I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but I'm also sick. After a day or two of the ""keto flu,"" I started to get a cold. So even though I'm past normal keto sickness, I'm feeling pretty shitty. 

Sorry for the long post!! I'm just very confused with what's happening to my body, and I would love some help. Thank you!

"Is it appropriate to add choline to the ""Don't be deficient"" sidebar?",1,8ohxku,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/8ohxku/is_it_appropriate_to_add_choline_to_the_dont_be/,69,1528153277.0,"The sidebar contains articles written by Jack Norris, RD so I assume he's a reliable and valid source of information for this subreddit. His article on choline states that the DRI for it is 425 for 19+ year old women and 550 for a 19+ year old man (it seems like he personally recommends at least 300mg). He also states that getting enough betaine may somewhat reduce the need for choline as the body turns choline into betaine. I feel like this is important, and no one is talking about it.

The foods highest in choline (not counting dried beans/grains) would be legumes, nuts/seeds, and some greens. Soy products contain ~100mg per 100g, tomatoes ~100mg per 100g, flaxseed ~79mg per 100g, peanut butter  ~60mg per 100g, cashews ~60mg, shiitake ~60mg, cauliflower ~45mg, cooked collards ~45mg, etc.

For betaine, [he recommends eating higher than average amounts of betaine] (https://veganhealth.org/choline/#src) in your diet. Good sources would be raw/boiled spinach at ~550-577mg per 100g, beets at ~129-220mg per 100g, and after which the betaine content drops significantly to ~30-60g per 100g for some grains, and ~30g for sunflower seeds and sweet potatoes. I don't think he mentions how much betaine reduces the RDA for choline, but since choline has unique properties and cannot be fully replaced by betaine, it's safe to assume you still need a significant amount.

It seems pretty easy to miss out on choline. Here's an [example diet that Jack Norris ate](https://veganhealth.org/choline/#table2), he got 342mg of choline (potentially more since some entries didn't report the amount of choline), but he also ate a lot of soy products which are the among the top plant sources of choline. He recommends to get at least 300mg of choline, but he said that he ate 2716 calories that day, and that may be more than most people eat. He concludes that it may be a good idea to include more choline rich food sources in one's diet, but he advises against going significantly over the DRI without a physician's approval.

I'm also trying to build muscle as a primary goal and intend to consume a significant (i.e. >20%) caloric intake above my metabolic needs as part of that.

I've been browsing for a while with this keto diet. Seems to be quite promising to skin off my 8kg layers of fat.


My question seems to be pretty obvious, but i'd just like to confirm it. Would it help at all if I just do keto for dinner and breakfast? and still eat like normal for the rest of the day? Thing is, I work long hours.. and my partner who definitely doesn't need keto and doesn't want to go into keto diet cooks my lunch. So the only convenient time for me to cook is after I get home at night, for dinner...


Just would like to confirm if it would help at all.


As an Asian, I have lots of rice as part of my dish.. which I would expect to be part of my lunch in the future. If I were to go ahead with this, then only dinner's rice gonna get cut off. Also, it would be a bit too hard for me to let go of my partner's delicious cooking entirely at once. 


I already thought of a few recipe for the week's dinner, let me know what you think!


Day 1: Oatmeal + banana
Day 2: scrambled egg + bacon + spinach + cauliflower
Day 3: chicken soup (diced chicken fillet, cauliflower, carrot, and other vegie I can grab hold of in the fridge)
Day 4: Roast chicken + cauliflower
Day 5: Chicken nugget (diced chicken fillet fried with butter, recipe I saw in the net) + egg + banana
Weekend: Don't know yet, maybe take a break from Keto if I found it hard to keep up during the week.

Reason I've got lots of cauliflower there? I loveeeeee potato, it's my favourite food. I saw it somewhere cauliflower may be suitable to replace potato. Unforunately my potato is high in Carb T_T


Also, basically, Keto is a high fat, low carb and low sugar diet yeah? And aims to have max. 100g of Carb per day? CMIIW.

In order to keep the results from keto, will I have to stay keto the rest of my life or can I slowly add carbs back into my life in moderation without losing the results? 

Also, I’ve heard some people go 0 carbs while others say you can eat 40 carbs or less. Which one did you do and what were your results? 
How did keto affect your workouts in the beginning?
I started keto several months ago but quit after a week as I lost all energy and strength and it freaked me out as I have to stay in shape since I’m in the military. 

Another worry I have with keto is several years ago I was eating very low carb while working out all the time. The doctor said I had ketone in my kidney or liver (forget which one) and said I needed to eat more carbs or I would die. 😬

But by some kind of miracle I chose to stick it out and suddenly the cravings were gone and pounds were just melting away. My skin is clearer, I finally got my period back, I don’t sweat doing little things, I don’t dread having to pick something up off the floor, I sleep so much better, my pre-diabetic dark spots are fading away, I’m no longer grumpy and moody all day, and I have SO MUCH ENERGY!! I used to love bumming on the couch after putting the baby to bed, but now I hate it because I get so damn bored sitting around doing nothing! 

This is the BEST thing I have ever done. I am so fucking proud of myself. If I was able to make the change, so can you.

I've been at 197.5 for about 5 days, and I've been on the plant based diet for 2 weeks.

Let me tell you a typical day's worth of food:

Breakfast: Oats with blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, banana, cocoa powder, ground flax/chia seeds.  The fruit makes up about half the bowl.  I'll often try to fit in a handful of nuts.  

Lunch: 1-2 bowls of this vegetable soup I've made.  It has navy beans, kidney beans, pinto/black beans, lentils, barley, spinach, kale, carrots, celery, turmeric in it.  I might have one to two pieces of fruit with this meal.  Usually apple, pear, or berries.  I might also have a half bar of 70%+ dark chocolate, but I've been trying to cut back on that.  

Dinner: Maybe another bowl of vegetable soup.  Lots of fruit.  Maybe a peanut butter and banana sandwich on a slice of toasted whole grain bread.  Last night I kind of went crazy and had 2-3 handfuls of dark chocolate covered almonds, but I've been pretty good at avoiding dark chocolate the last 3 days before that.

I've done keto since before Atkins, and it's gotten better through the years. However, I was only really able to lose most of the weight last year from intermittent fasting (see not eating much during the day) and limiting carb intake to around 18-20 carbs a day from vegetables.

However, ever since breaking keto for the 2019 holidays followed by quarantine, I've gained it all back.

In the past, many things led to plateaus such as ""sugar-free"" candies, sauces and condiments with uncounted sugar, beer and/or alcohol, too many little treats, etc.

I've been trying to get back into ketosis like crazy.  I amped up the coconut oil and the avocados,  eliminated all the unsafe things like berries and any unnecessary sugars, and I even went without drinking any alcohol for almost two weeks, but I just can't seem to get back to the type of losses I'm used to seeing.

Once I got back into ketosis, I'm seriously used to seeing 5-10 lbs disappear in a week or two and then 1-2 lbs every couple of days, but that's simply not happening anymore. 

Maybe it's age, or stress, or the almost complete lack of exercise due to zoom calls and desk work instead of running around like I used to.

I've also started to see too many articles about how the diet is ""unsustainable"" and can be bad for your heart and such. I've never believed those articles because I've always had good checkups while on keto, but now, it seems like the only consistent benefit of a keto diet is the one thing that's never changed. I know it may not be responsible, but you gotta appreciate the positives. I love protein, and I can eat as much keto food as I want without gaining. That's usually the best part of the diet. However, I really want to get back to losing and I'm not willing to exercise or make any more drastic changes and I'm just getting burned out.",1

I’d lost about 15 lbs (5 lbs a month) just doing the meal plan so I felt good about trying a keto thing out. She told me to try adding in some simple body weight exercises (squats, lunges, calf raises) and not worry about running (my exercise of choice).

This month was my a bunch of birthdays and patio invited so I cheated more than I might like to admit. But I was still net under my calories each week and was keeping keto enough to get “keto flu” when I got back into it, so I thought, ok, I’m still good. Plus my husband and I started playing tennis every night and I was walking the dog a lot more, so my activity numbers were really good.

Lo and behold, 3 weeks in, my weight on the bathroom scale started going up. I started panicking a little — had I hit a plateau? Was it water weight? I cut back on sodium to see if that would help but, nope.

I went into my nutritionist on Monday feeling like a high schooler who hadn’t done her homework. My weight was up for sure.

When she did the magical full body scan though, she was totally pleased.

Not only had I lost 5 lbs of fat from last time, but I’d gained 4 lbs of muscle. I dropped 2% in total body fat percentage and gained 70 calories/day in BMR. She said it was the best improvement she’s seen in three years and told me to keep doing what I’m doing.

18 days on keto (in an hour). I’d sunken into a dark place and lost myself in the ideals of a man that would never be able to see me for the woman I am and love her. From 170 I hit 230. Yo-yoing here and there with a variety of diets/lifestyles including keto but never stuck to it. Would inevitably find ways to cheat here and there and lie to myself that “I’ll just start again tomorrow”. Finding comfort in that tiny shock of happiness my brain would light up when I’d eat something that reminded me of a better time in my life. 

Then I tried another “lifestyle change” while I loved it, again old habits died hard. Then a couple of weeks ago I decided enough was enough. When I was walking the groceries into the house and wanted to cry because I was just TOO exhausted to deal I knew it was time. I left that relationship. I stopped buying food I know I shouldn’t eat. I started strict keto including the guidelines to the cutting out sugar or sweeteners cut out the dairy and focused on lean meat, “healthy fats” veggies and rewarding with lower carb fruit and just telling myself to quit being a baby and drink the water. 

So here I am, motivated, burning clean energy and feeling like I used to. Happy to be here, seeing all the positive posts from other redditors. Here’s to us! 🥂.",1

Hey there, I’ll make this short and sweet. I’m in my mid 20s, I’m a very athletic male, and for the past two years I stuck mostly to a lazy keto diet,  (my carbohydrates would only come from fruits or vegetables, NO flours). 

This worked well for me but when I had problem trimming some fat in my midsection I thought it’d be nice to change my diet. ENTER the Plant based diet that ive been on for the past 2 weeks.

I feel amazing. In 2 weeks the adipose fat tissue I just ‘couldn’t’ burn from diet or exercise has mostly melted away. I’m happier, mentally clearer, less inflammation, stronger, just overall almost optimal. Probably never going back. BUT the reason I’m posting is because I sometimes feel weak in the mornings or at night when on this diet and want to know what I’m doing wrong? Is this just all the years of meat products still doing me dirty? I no longer crave meat FYI, just cruciferous vegetables now.

It could also be from my workouts (I run 3-5 miles a day and do moderate lifting) but I think I get enough protein through a plant protein mix I drink 2-3x a day.  

I want to keep up this diet but I’m really a novice at this point and only know I need to watch my vitamins and protein intake (due to exercise). Please help me with any tips or suggestions on all of this- anything that helps a newbie like me would be greatly appreciated.",0

I am new to the Keto journey and reddit. This is my first post ever. I started about 3 weeks ago. Only focused on hitting protein and carb macros and ate fat to be satisfied. Read through the FAQ and decided I wasn’t going to count calories my first few weeks in order to become fat adapted. 

Now that I’m adapted I downloaded carb manager and logged my first day of food. I wanted to double check that my macro goals are correct for my weight, height and age. My current weight is 112 kg and my height is 167 cm. My calorie goal (with 25% deficit) is 1605. Carbs are 19g, protein is 150g and fat is 103g. 
I went for high-protein keto since that sounded good on the carb manager app (please let me know if this is not recommended) has a ratio of 5:35:60. But was wondering if my protein intake is too high? Ate around 232 grams today, is this not suggested? I hit about 80 grams of fat and hunger is sated. Drinking salted broth and potassium/magnesium drinks daily too. Only hit 13g carbs.

I’ve been wanting to make a post for some time now but I’ve lacked motivation to do so; but not today! Not necessarily help, I want to make this post because in a way, I want it to help me keep accountable like I did a year ago. A little back story: I started keto on June when I was fed up and said eff this. I did it last year up until the holidays and lost 75 pounds (I’ll always toot my horn for that tbh). But I stopped during the holiday season because  ✨Latino✨ food is life and a lot of stuff in our family we only cook for the holidays. After that period I did low carb in January but again stopped because it was my birthday in February and I wanted to eat and drink without a care. Then obviously quarantine hit in March, and to sprinkle some more stuff in my life—in my moms ongoing cancer treatments, my grandmother whom helped raised me get diagnosed for cancer in April, and my mental health declining I haven’t been able to jump back in. 

As previously mentioned, I need help being kept accountable right now just because lately I’ve been at one of my worst mental health periods where just little things are making me explode. Example, yesterday I had a fight with my mom because we couldn’t decide on a place to eat and had a very stressful fight that I ended up breaking keto. Which back story to the backstory—This past Monday I started keto again and during the whole week I was SOOOOO good about it and felt amazing! However, I’m not letting this little emotional binge set me back—I’m starting a 24 hr fast tonight, plus my regular IF schedule, and jumping back on keto Tuesday. 

Thanks for hearing me ramble. If you guys have any tips or tricks up your sleeve, please feel free to message me. I’m also very open to friends who do this lifestyle because it can be hard sometimes and talking about it with my best friend doesn’t always help because she doesn’t get it.

Really up until last month I have been going full damage mode on my body for 30 years. Soda and unhealthy processed foods multiple times a day. More meat than I can count or even contemplate how much I’ve eaten throughout my life. And all the other BS I’ve eaten throughout my life with no regard for my health. Let alone, cigarettes and Juul a good portion of my life. I was never informed before going up in the house very neat driven and not really health-conscious. Obviously the tobacco and nicotine I was aware of. Yesterday I went for a run in the first time in about six months and nearly died when I came back. Couldn’t stand without getting lightheaded and almost falling had a cough and started getting shivers. So I was bed ridden. 


Yesterday I watched “game changers“. It was an awesome documentary and I’m so happy I watched it because it gave me the push that I needed. I’ve been dealing with ulcerative Colitis us for about 10 years now with no end in sight. Just saw a holistic doctor and now he’s got me on a few natural remedies. I’m essentially trying everything I can before I switch to Humira for life (which I do not want to do). Changed if diet and medicine. I started last month with a pescatarian diet but now I’m cutting out fish and eggs also. Only veggies from here. 

It’s weird starting on the eve of Thanksgiving the day we’re all the food comes out. I’m sure I’m gonna hear some grief from family and friends but a small price to pay for my health. Just wanna say I’m happy I found the sub Reddit and happy to be a part of this community now. Just had my first plant-based breakfast and it was delicious! 

Thank you all and love y’all! Let’s change the world together!",0

I put on weight with my first child. Had to lose a lot to even get pregnant with my second but gained it all back plus some. Highest weight 250. Current 232ish. 

Tonight, after confiscating 116 oxycodone 10mg  from a patient and pissing her the eff off she went off on me. It’s okay, she’d been going off on us all night because we wouldn’t keep her doped up. Then I found the meds and all hell broke loose. 

Afterwards, when another nurse entered the room (mind you, we are all garbed up from head to toe) she says, “are you that fat bi*ch that was just in here. You tell that fat bitch if she comes in here again I’m going to shoot her. I’m going to find a gun and shoot her”. 

This woman is in her 70s 

But the fat comment stuck. I’m home now and I can’t shake it. I usually have an amazing sense of humor and can shake everything off. I was even joking around that I was going to make a shirt with that in quotes on it. 

But I can’t stop thinking, “I really have gained weight.”

I’m...I’m cured...,342,fwgts0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/fwgts0/imim_cured/,51,1586276719.0,"TL;DR This diet cured my chronic severe IBS in 4 days. Why don’t people talk about meat sensitivity?!

I just wanted to write this somewhere. I had another great day today and I wanted to vent about this but for reasons that are about to become obvious I can’t do that everywhere.

6ish weeks ago I watched Game Changers and listened to the Joe Rogan podcast debate and decided I’d give the diet a try. I’m a bit chubby and I run so I needed a change to get to a half marathon.

After only 4 days something else happened. 

I have IBS and it was just absolutely controlling my life. It had gotten so bad I’ve been hospitalized twice. I tried low FODMAP, high fiber, keto, cutting out allergens, gluten, dairy...everything else and nothing helped. I even lost 80 pounds in case it was because I was fat, but that didn’t help. I was living day by day on OTC meds just knowing this sickness was destroying my digestive system. I cried at least once a week. 

I had never thought to give up meat. It honestly never occurred to me because that’s not something you see on guides about how to eat for IBS. But 4 days on a wfpb diet my IBS was gone. Just completely gone. I have had this issue since 2007 and I had forgotten what it was like to live without it. 

In the past 6 weeks I’ve cheated with fish and chicken and eggs on a few occasions and the IBS flares up right away and takes about 2 days to go back to normal. 

Dairy doesn’t seem to do anything bad, but also I don’t love dairy and I don’t believe it’s healthy so I cut back on that too.

WHY isn’t this talked about more often? I feel like if I went into r/ibs today and posted this I would be hit with a ton of resistance. If you recommend wfpb for health people just roll their eyes. But apparently meat sensitivity is an actual thing so why isn’t that talked about?! I mean, we talk about gluten sensitivity all the time! 

I love meat, but it’s not worth the torture I was going through. I’ll probably cheat here and there but I think I’m mostly plant based for life now.",0

# Jillian Michaels Says 'Don't Do Keto' If You Want To Lose Weight

The keto diet is everywhere right now, so it’s totally understandable if you’ve started to think that keto = the yellow brick road to all your weight\-loss #goalz. But Jillian Michaels says that’s just not true.The celebrity trainer tells [*People*](https://people.com/food/jillian-michaels-fad-diets-keto-diet/) in a new interview, that it’s really not a good idea for the average person to go on the keto diet.“Don’t do keto,” she says. “How much time do I have? And I’m not allowed to swear? Yes, keto is a diet fad. The reason that keto has been getting so much attention is because it helps significantly to manage your insulin levels. Very high insulin, very bad thing.”  
Keto might be good for people with health conditions associated with very high insulin levels, she says, but it doesn’t make sense for most people.In fact, if you just try to eat healthy, the keto diet is totally unnecessary, she says. “If you’re not eating a bunch of [processed carbs](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a19942136/surprising-foods-with-refined-carbs/) and processed sugar and you’re not eating too much food in general, you won’t have insulin levels that are going through the roof,” she says.Jillian also says people may think, ""'Oh, I'm keto so I can eat whatever and I don't count calories!'"" while they're on a high\-fat plan like keto. But, she says: “Calorie management and calorie restriction is less oxidative stress, so it’s far better for aging and being healthier,” she says. ",1

Been a raw vegan for a year, experimented with fasting and atkins prior to that and now 2 weeks into keto.

One thing i enjoy about eating a certain way is listening to the diet ""gurus"". The starch munchers have dr mcdougall that walks his talk, The vegans have heaps of charasmatic athletes that embody health and vibrant living, even the paleo crowd has some funny celebs. 

Keto needs some super fit, awesome people.

All i see out of the keto world are fat middle age people doing fat bomb recipes on youtube and bragging about how much bacon and cheese they eat.

As for so called gurus in keto, just finished reading keto clarity and watching jimmy moore vids on youtube, i think he does more harm than good for getting keto out there. Just read what he eats in a typical day, god damn, no wonder he is still fat. That guy is a dairy sausage munching beast.

I dont mean to sound judgemental but when i tell people i'm doing keto and these are the people that represent the diet to my friends/family, they fear for me lol.

I'm convinced on keto and am enjoying my leafy greens but enough with the book sales if you look like crap and have extremely poor health.

It was all over her bones and lymph nodes, but after taking a new hormone medication 11 months ago, it completely disappeared. We were hoping to get a few years out of the treatment before the cancer mutated and figured out how to get around it. Unfortunately, after 9 months, it showed up again in her scans. We were devastated, and decided to switch to MD Anderson in Houston, the best cancer hospital in the world. Our appointment was scheduled 1.5 months out, and she had to stop treatment because of the wash out period for any potential clinical trials that she might be eligible for at Anderson. So for 1.5 months, the cancer was in her body, unopposed by any treatment. 

When it came back, that’s when I started hitting the books hard. Long story short, I ended up reading How. Not to Die and The China Study (among others), and we decided to switch our diets completely, and on a dime. Plus no alcohol. When we brought this up to her oncologist, he told us point blank, “unfortunately, nutrition doesn’t matter.” Of course, this is devastating to hear from the person who is supposed to be the expert, and we were thankful to be getting out of that hospital. 

MD Anderson was different. While we were disappointed that her new oncologist was not up-to-speed with science of nutrition, we were at least thankful that he didn’t dismiss the idea. Instead, he put us in touch with his colleague, an integrative oncologist - an actual MD who FINALLY validated all the changes we had made. He was even able to clarify a few questions we had about conflicting things we had read (like about oils and coffee). 

On to the point...we were also put in touch with a researcher on the cutting edge of immunotherapy, who told us she was eligible for an exciting new trial. Halfway through the appointment, he and his assistants started looking at her newest scans that had just come through. They had confused looks on their faces, they had to confer, and then they had to apologize to us because she was no longer eligible for this exciting new trial. Of the three tumors which showed up on her previous scans, ONE WAS TOTALLY GONE, AND THE OTHER TWO WERE SHOWING ALL THE SIGNS OF DISAPPEARING AND THE BONES HEALING THEMSELVES!!!! On no treatment, they should have been about the same size or larger. The only thing we had done for the past month and a half was drastically change our diets to WFPB. 

Of course, who knows what the next scans will show. It’s always terrifying to get those results. But we almost told the doctor to hold off on the new second-line treatment to see if diet alone was able to keep it in check. In the end, it was too scary to do that, so she is on treatment again, but I am fairly sure we will stick with this diet for the rest of our lives. Plus, I’ve lost 20 pounds, have more energy and mental clarity than I’ve had since high school, and have no more bowel issues. It is absolute insanity that more people don’t know/care about WFPB. Especially mother F%*#-ing doctors.",0

Just a reminder that it's okay to transition into WFPB.,252,bbu13l,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/bbu13l/just_a_reminder_that_its_okay_to_transition_into/,34,1554973755.0,"EDIT: Thank you for the gold, that's really kind!  And apologies for the few who read this as a criticism of the sub.  It certainly isn't. I don't think this sub would be nearly as useful if it was a guide to transitioning and eating non-compliant things. It needs to be a sub about compliance, and I just wanted to speak to the people (who I know exist!) who feel out of place or uncertain if it's 'ok' to be noncompliant on the journey to compliant. 

\--

&#x200B;

This isn't a sub where there's a lot of support for the *journey* from a typical diet to WFPB. This is a sub where most of the content is established, entirely compliant WFPB resources.

&#x200B;

I understand why: it's difficult to find resources for WFPB-eating, especially oil-free, and if you want to find a recipe with just 'a little oil' or something where just a touch of sugar is used, you can find that almost anywhere in the abundance of vegan recipe subs and websites around the internet. Finding WFPB-specific research and 100% compliant recipes is tough, and a sub like this a goldmine for those of us who don't want to figure out how to adapt a recipe for the 19th time, we just want a good recipe for sugar and oil-free banana bread, damn it.

&#x200B;

But--and this is a big but--we are so used to having to clap back at people who feed us misinformation about oil and sugar that the second we get a whiff of noncompliance around here, there can be a pretty brutal backlash. In my opinion, this can sometimes feel like if you're not perfectly WFPB, you're an alien here.

&#x200B;

Questions like: **""Is it okay if I eat one cheat meal a week?""** Or **""Bonsoy has a touch of added sugar, is it okay if I drink a morning coffee each day with Bonsoy?""** Are quick to get a huge mix of responses varying from articles on the effect of processed sugar on rats to the anecdotal: ""I eat a Snickers once a week and my doctor says I'm the healthiest 114-year-old he's ever seen.""

&#x200B;

The problem is, this is a sub and way of life focused on quantitative research.  ""Okay"" is subjective and varies depending on what lens you're looking through.

&#x200B;

**Is it okay to eat a little sugar now and again?**

&#x200B;

I don't know. Does eating a vegan brownie once a week keep you satisfied enough to maintain WFPB-compliance for the other 21+ meals a week? If you don't eat the vegan brownie, are you going to have a binge eating session in three days because you restricted too hard for your current mental health state? Then, I guess it's okay for now. Keep working on it.

&#x200B;

**I switched to veganism last NYE, but I'm having trouble kicking oil, how bad is it?**

&#x200B;

Well, if you ask us, we're going to say it's pretty bad because of its direct link to arterial damage.  But if you went from eating McDonalds six times a week to eating salads and black bean burgers, dude, good for you. Keep working on it.

&#x200B;

**I drank a milkshake yesterday and now I feel gross.**

&#x200B;

Shoot. Hopefully you remember this feeling next time you crave one. Keep trucking.

&#x200B;

I know a lot of people switch to WFPB overnight and that's freaking awesome. The sooner you can start eating well, the better. Of course.  But if you're like me, it takes time.

&#x200B;

It took me **two years** of falling and getting back up before I could even see that I'd made any progress in changing my very, very, very bad diet that I'd had since birth.  It started with just eating WFPB lunches at work four days a week. It took a full year of doing that before I was ready to make the next step. (And I messed that up all the time, too, before it started to become a habit.)

&#x200B;

After that, I made the complete switch to veganism, and while I was eating WFPB more regularly, I was also eating non-dairy Ben and Jerrys between my SOS-free curries and tofu burgers. And it took a long time for me not to feel like a failure because of it.  I gave myself no credit for switching to veganism because I was focused on perfection, and nothing less, no step toward it, would ever suffice to sate my perfectionism.

&#x200B;

Then, I quietly started to focus on cutting out added sugar.  It took three months, but now I can say I have more days not eating sugar than I do eating sugar--and that's huge for me.

&#x200B;

Now I can focus on oil.

&#x200B;

I'm sure my waistline and my organs would be a whole happier had it not took me two years to put a dent in my SAD way of eating, but eating is not just rational. It is *emotional*, it is *cultural*, and these behaviours, misinformation, and addictions are rooted deep. My brain needs time to heal before my body can. And I'm happy that I finally gave myself the wiggle room to step down instead of berating myself every day for not being able to wake up, switch the flip on, and be perfect.

&#x200B;

So... If you're feeling imperfect because your version of 'okay' is different than ours, just know that setbacks and imperfections are just opportunities to learn how to take the next step toward complete, whole-body wellness. And know that you're not alone, and some of us are transitioning and still entirely welcome here to learn, contribute, and grow.

I've been overweight since puberty with occasional failed attempts to diet. This is just so easy to stick to. Breakfast is normally scrambled eggs with cheese and bacon. Lunch is some meat with veg and boiled egg. Mostly the same for dinner. After the first few weeks my appetite started dropping. I have a fridge full of keto friendly snack foods that it's taking ages to get through. My taste buds have changed. I now like ultra dark chocolate and coffee where I never did before. I'm T2 diabetic and my blood sugar control now seems to be perfect with diet alone (Review in a few weeks).

Everything feels so positive now. I walked to the supermarket to buy some pepperoni and a steak yesterday and part way there there's a hill I always struggled with. Not this time. I was barely winded. I look forward to getting on my scales first thing every morning. Even when I stall for a few days, Cutting carbs from my diet has probably been the best thing I've ever done in my life.

Another 7 pounds and I'm under 20 stone for the first time in over 10 years. I can't wait My target is 18 stone before my holiday in May. Personally I think I can do it.

The one thing that's weird is I have no idea where the weight is vanishing from. My measurements have hardly changed. Trousers are a bit looser but not to any great degree (And a tape measure confirms this). According to my scales my fat mass % is dropping steadily but apart from my face I can't see. No matter though. If I keep loosing it has to come from MA BIG BELLY at some point :)

I lost 22 pounds my first month, and I'm now down 30 pounds, and within spitting distance  (5 lbs) of ""normal, Class I obese."" 

And that's all great. I mean, I'm so thankful for it. But even more, I'm glad that I no longer crave sugar.  I was the woman who lived off dessert and diet sodas. Recently, I ""cheated"" with a bite of my son's apple (still within daily carbs), and it was shocking how sweet it was. If I have cravings for off plan foods, that's what it is, fruit, or maybe a potato. I honestly never think of cookies or candy.

There's an outside chance I could start the new year as ""just overweight."" I appreciate that's unlikely, but I should at least be under 200 lbs, and I'll never be so happy to just miss a goal.

Several people said I shouldn’t go back but I did...

First came the talk...  I showed her my app with my food consumption over the past month (since “that” visit)...  she said I was eating too many calories (2100)...  she role
Me I was eating too much fat (~150g per day)...  she suggested adding carbs “for a balanced diet”...  she told me there wasn’t proof Keto would help me...  I admitted I haven’t had the time yet to go to the gym...  and then she got me to stand on the scales...

Even though I bought new scales I hadn’t weighed myself in the past month because I wanted to focus on my eating...

So four weeks after my last visit...  current weight 159.6kg - a 5.4kg loss.

It felt great...  I must admit she blushed a little and that made her look cute...  we sat back down and she said “that’s great progress” but cautioned me about losing weight too quickly.

She said it was nice to have a client that was really committed to changing his lifestyle...  and commented on the frustration of seeing people that didn’t even recognise they had a problem.

We had a very different chatbthan last time - and after a few compliments from her I couldn’t help it and I said, “you should stop flirting with me...  I’m a happily married man”.

She went beetroot red and apologised - I don’t know why because she wasn’t really fitting, it was just chatting.

She asked if I wanted another appointment but I declined.  She asked where I was getting the Keto information from and I said Reddit (hello if you’re reading right now)...  and I left feeling freaking awesome.

I’ve got a lot more to learn about Keto but I really don’t think I can learn it from her.

Now I use my scales daily...  it’s satisfying...  and a few members of my family have also modified their eating (and have got results).

Edit:  I forgot to mention one thing...  she was so flustered at the end of the visit she forgot to get the form signed that allows her to claim for the scheduled fees.  I scanned it and emailed it to her.  She replied to thank me,  and said “congrats again.  Let me know if I can help in any way”.

Did you experience such symptoms when you began this diet? 

Could it be intolerances?

EDIT:
For answering your questions...
I'm French so I always had the chance to eat well balanced and good products. So definitely not the typical/basic american diet. Of course, this diet was based on animal products but I always composed my plate 4/10 veggies, 3/10 carbs and 3/10 meat.
I suffer of irritable bowel syndrome, as well as a slight insulin resistance due to polycistic ovaries.
I have another issue with carbs: I'm constantly hungry after eating carbs. 
I must add that I'm not planning on going fully vegan for now as I dont feel ready yet. 
But I would try to eat PBF the week, and omnivorous on the week-ends. For now. 

Few examples of what I eat this week:
- falafels, whole grain rice (soy cream & curry), salad (lettuce, tomatoes, corn, black radish, nuts mix) 
- seitan cooked with onions and mushroom (soy cream & french mustard), potatoes, brocolis
- vegetable soy protein cooked as caramel pork, cauliflower, whole grain pasta, carot salad with citrus

I ate meat for supper and I must admit I'm well better now. Damn. I didn't mention that I was experiencing dizziness that disappear after this meal. That's very weird.

Is  « raw garlic intolerance » a thing? I eat a lot of salad and always add a ton of garlic in the sauce. I noticed recently this is very often followed by reflux and garlic tasting burps.",0
Just started keto + IF and things seems to be OK,0,uao49,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/uao49/just_started_keto_if_and_things_seems_to_be_ok/,3,1338344009.0,"A week ago I started playing with the idea of IF(intermittent fasting) with a 18/6 breakdown and frankly it wasn't different than what I've actually been doing. It just had eliminated the snacking, which gave me an idea; that if eating is out of question (i.e. fasting) during a period, it is actually easier to stick with it then constantly monitor and regulate intake. Mind you no keto yet.

Meanwhile I've got more interested in fasting and started going through some scientific papers. Long story short I decided to take a ""water fast"" just to experiment. I was just going to see how it feels, and I didn't have an ending point at mind.

This empiricism revealed quite interesting remarks such as I had an anxiety associated with being hungry, therefore a non existant tolerance to hunger. I also had a misconception that you'd just die if you fast longer than a day.

Quite the contrary, the experience helped me to conquer and flirt with the feeling of hunger, that it is transient and body is quite able to take it. At the same time I was starting to be concerned about burning of too much muscle and losing important micronutrients.

At around 45th hour of the fast I started discussing this concern with my friend. He pointed to very low calorie diets (~500kcal) that are administered in hospitals in order not to be deprived of the essential stuff. I could use this and still not totally beat the idea of fasting.

So I decided to break the fast with a very low cal meal. Now the composition was interesting to choose, I didn't have much control to fine tune micronutrients but at least on the macro level I knew I'd need protein and fat, first for at least slowing down muscle burndown, second for easing absorption of vitamins I've been taking as a pill (vit E for example) and other stuff like hormones.

I had had some knowledge of keto and it occured to me that this first meal was perfectly keto; bacon strips, mushrooms, 2 eggs, some little feta cheese, spices. Coming from a 48 hour full fast, this was a ""holy"" meal, with an overload of taste and joy. 

At this point I was still assuming I could go on 600kcal/day, but it would inevitably be keto so I started hanging around this sub to get some ideas on what to eat.

Again coming from full fast, next day not eating till 18.00 was easy. But just before the meal of the day I felt a bit dizzy different than when I was fasting, it was a bit more ""realistic"" and closer to fainting. Then I said maybe it's good to go full on keto, at least getting the vital nutrients so it would actually be sustainable and I don't damage anything inside.

Here I am, today is the second day of full keto. Although I know not obligatory, I'm still keeping the IF (or more like warrior diet, i.e. one meal per day, since I eat once a day) and it actually seems to be OK for several reasons;

- I knew the keto food can get old pretty fast. With one meal a day, this seems to be less of an issue. Meals still taste like holy, it takes less effort to prepare, and saving all from breakfast and lunch I buy the best stuff for dinner (steaks, salmon, good cheese)

- ""Hunger"" or ""low energy"" theoretically shouldn't be a problem, as being always on ketosis, whether from something I eat or my belly, I do have constant energy source. In practice this was more or less the case. Still it might be possible that empty stomach is producing some ""grehlin"" (hunger stuff) etc, but I do not get hunger pangs, just more like an acquired habit of thinking about food which releases stomach acids and saliva causing some discomfort. 

- The initial fasting, although not intentional, was a quick dive to ketosis for one. It also helped the transition to keto mentally (I couldn't imagine starting of after a day of chips and ice cream). Lastly, at least for my case I taught me about the benign nature of hunger response, and let me some distance from the food.

Now the experience goes on. I thought it might be helpful to share at least the IF part. Here are some other titbits;

- 289 lbs starting weight, 282 lbs now. I know, water weight and stuff, not extrapolating anything of it.

- I have home gym, so doing weight training at my pace (very minimal at this phase). Along with all the fat I also had quite a bit muscle, but all was of isolated weight training. Now I wanna give starting strength a try.

- I do wanna keep some ""cardio"", for the sake of cardio, as sitting whole day at a job feels just as unhealthy as sugars. Some biking relieves further stress, increases circulation, and is fun.

- I experienced mood stability, or a different mindset, and I like it. I find it easier to concentrate and keep it for long.

- When munching on random shitty food is not an option of fun, it becomes obligatory to actually fill the life better. I.e. if I find myself contemplating about pizza and stuff, or just plain mount watering, I just get myself busy with something meaningful. For example with random reddit, I still get a bit of intrusions, but something more ""flowy"" I totally forget about it.

- Yes now I perceive the lanes of carby foods at supermarket to be ""evil"" or ""poison"". I know, there might be a room of exaggeration here, but at least I have a stronger stance that just because it is available and cheap and legally sold doesn't mean it is actually good for you. Just because your mom used to cook it doesn't make it healthy. Basically everything after advent of agriculture is open for questioning.

- Bought ketostix just for the lulz. I think this particular biofeedback, although redundant to a degree, does reinforce the intended course of action (keto in this case). And I like peeing on stuff. ",1
"Just starting Keto, struggling",0,2ww179,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/2ww179/just_starting_keto_struggling/,26,1424741564.0,"Okay this is probably going to be really long. My boyfriend is all about this diet and finally got me to try it. He loves it, but I am really hating it. I know you can get 'ketoflu' and I get dizzy sometimes, and super tired. I sleep better(when my cat leaves me alone) but when I wake up, I don't want to get out of bed for hours. I think this diet is actually making me depressed. I feel like I can't eat anything I like. I was/am a vegetarian, but I'm posting to this sub and not vegetarianketo because I would eat bacon and tuna sometimes. So I tried to incorporate that more into my diet. I also am a terrible vegetarian because I don't really like any beans or grains besides wheat and white rice and green beans. I'm a pretty picky eater so I feel like this diet is a lot harder on me than my boyfriend. He loves meat and hates veggies so this diet is basically perfect for him, he has veggieshakes to make up for not eating any and loves snacking on nuts and jerky all day. Well after 2 days of ham and tuna, I'm really sick of it and don't want it anymore. I actually did reach ketosis on day 2 though(my pee had the consistency of syrup) but on day 3 I got really emo about not being able to eat basically anything I like, so I had 2 doughnut holes(not that I really wanted those but they happened to be on the table) and skipped lunch altogether, because I'd rather not eat than eat tuna or ham again lol The only thing I really look forward to eating everyday is my apple slices with peanut butter which you really aren't supposed to eat anyways, but if I can't enjoy an apple then fuck this shit. =p

Anyways, I guess what I'm wondering is, is it normal to also feel depressed at first? Or is this diet probably not for me and I should try something else? I used to eat almost all carbs exclusively, though I like some veggies and fruits too.  I don't really eat a lot of junkfood or sugary things, though I did have a pretty heinous soda addiction but I managed to switch to green tea and haven't really been craving it since then. Cheese and some nuts are fine too(cashews, pecan, peanuts, almonds) but I don't really like snacking on them every day as my only snack because I can't even have yogurt anymore.(I hate greek yogurt so please don't even say that. =p) Would it be better for me to eat one carb meal a day, but otherwise keep up the keto thing? Or would that not really make any difference/ depends too much on being in ketosis? Or does this feeling pass if you stick with it? Are there any picky eaters here that managed to have this diet work for them?

I've never had tofu before and don't really feel like experimenting with a tasteless substitute meatblock. I'm not a chef and I don't really like cooking. I've had vegetarian soy bacon but it has very little protein(nuts have more) so it doesn't seem worth adding.(especially if I will eat real bacon anyways)

Side note: I've never really done any diets before and I am not super overweight, I just need to lose around 10-15 lbs.

Mexican Chicken

3 cans of rotel tomatoes

colby jack cheese

cream of chicken soup

can of chicken

tortilla chips

white rice


Mix 2 cans of the tomatoes, chicken, and soup together. Brown the rice and add water and the last can of tomatoes. Put a layer of crushed tortilla chips in the bottom of a cake pan. Add the soup mixture. Top it with the cheese. Repeat this process like you are making a mexican lasagna. Bake at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes or until the cheese on top is slightly browned.

I was scared and ashamed and couldn't bring myself to tell my wife. I did what I always do and half ass tried to eat better. Then after about four or five months I told myself that I was hurting my kids as much as myself. I had no energy, I'd sit on the couch and nap while the kids played. I was failing them as a father.

So this past spring I finally stopped telling myself I couldn't do keto with carbs in the house and just did it. A week passed, then a month, then two. I was sticking to it and it was getting easier as time passed.

Fast forward to this morning and I went to see the doctor after doing bloodwork a few weeks back. Zero sign of diabetes, perfect cholesterol, no issues whatsoever. My doctor did a bit of a double take when she walked into the exam room. She was impressed with the 50lb weight loss and said whatever I was doing to keep it up, the results were fantastic.

I've been a long time lurker, but have never really had the guts to post anything much. Really I just now needed to say a big thank you to you all that make up this wonderful subreddit. Having such a constructive and knowledgeable community has really given me the confidence to press on and remain steadfast in keto when I've had so many doubters saying I'm crazy or being silly with the diet. 

I've always struggled with my weight (or view of myself) but have managed to mostly hide behind the fact that I do alot of physical contact sports so excess weight hasn't been a huge issue. The problem was growing into adulthood, I had so many more reasons to get into a bit better shape, finally being able to let my hair down a bit and not worry about breaking things, or being unaware of my size and weight. 

I've got some way to go to reach my goals, and keto might not be for life for me but having a tried and tested method to shift some body fat had been the literally been a life changing experience. Keep doing what you're doing people, there are many more non posters out there that are being inspired by you all every day. Thank you!

I think we can all be in such a good mindset for feeling happier about the way we look, whatever stage we're at. A lot of us started from a low point and I think that gives us an advantage, we weren't born with the skinny genes we've had to work for it, and I think it gives ketoers a better mindset than people gifted with the ability to eat whatever they want and stay trim. I'm going to stay forever humble and have realised that the best thing to come out of this journey is that I know what's really important, looks are great for self confidence and how you get treated, but the strength I've gained from knowing I can take control of my own body is the real gift.

KETO not working anymore?

Most of the time, it worked tremendously. Water weight in the first couple weeks. A few pounds here and there per week after that.

I've always stuck with the SAME diet everytime I am on keto.

The past three week I've done the same yet only have dropped 3-4 pounds which before I would lose at least 10 (most of it being water weight). I was 184 lb at 5'11"". I was expecting to be at least at 175lb but I am barely eclipsing 180.

Any idea why it is so slow? I've started keto at this exact weight and lost a few pounds more.

I only really eat steak + eggs + chicken + broccoli + spinach + cheese + shrimp + bacon. I almost always keep my net carbs at under 10. Sometimes even <5 or 0. The calorie intake is the same even when I weight less yet still lost weight. (1800-2500 with moderate excercise so net caloric intake roughly 1500-2200) I feel like I am not in ketosis yet. What can I do?  


EDIT: I do monitor my calories. All the food I eat are preportioned. All veggies I eat are low in calories and in net carbs. I've kept my intake with exercise at around 1500-2300 net. Every other time I've eaten keto I've never monitored my calorie intake and I am 100% sure that I've overeaten and eaten over 3000 calories each day yet I lost weight faster then what is happening now when I've been watching it.

Moderate amounts (meaning you need to track the carb counts) of:
> Processed (additives and preservatives) meat, nuts, low-carb root vegetables, peppers, low-carb legumes, low-carb dairy (if you feel bloated, try eliminating dairy except for hard cheeses)

Absolutely zero of:
> Grain, sugar, corn syrup, starchy legumes, starchy root vegetables

**What about low-carb bread, bars, shakes, tortillas, pasta, etc?**

YMMV, but I've consistently found that these products cause me to stop losing weight when I'm trying to reduce. Probably more appropriate for maintenance than initial weight loss. Don't eat.

**How many carbs per day should I be eating?**

My results tend to be best when I stay under 30g/day, which matches what many proponents of the diet have suggested, so that's what I suggest. If you follow the rules above, however, you will often find that you naturally eat fewer than 30/day. I haven't needed to count carbs in years; I just don't eat many or any foods that contain carbs.

**So I can just eat bacon all the time?**

No. Eat vegetables. If you don't like them, learn to prepare them. Butter and salt are your friends. *Edited to remove ""In large quantities"" due to needless controversy.*

**What about cheating?**

Don't. If you get to the point where you've been doing it for a while and understand how your body reacts, feel free. If you're reading a beginner's guide, just don't. It sets you back physically, emotionally, and chemically.

Not one piece of candy. Not one bite of chocolate. Not a taste of someone's cake. No cheating. It is far, far easier to have none than one because of the nature of habit. Like an alcoholic who intends to have one drink and ends up in a gutter, you'll intend to have one piece and end up eating 20. That's the nature of human habits, not a special weakness that only you have.

**What if I feel hungry?**

Eat fatty food and drink water. You're used to dieting by not eating; get over that. You are now dieting by eating. If you feel like you're eating and eating and still hungry, you're not hungry - you're craving junk food.

**What do I do if I cheat?**

It happens. Oops, I ate a donut. You'll probably be tempted to say, ""Well, I'll start again tomorrow."" Fuck that. Start again now. The donut was a mistake, don't compound it by making deals with yourself. Respond to cheats by going back to the correct diet immediately.

**Should I weigh myself?**

Yes, and here's how: Wake up, pee, step on the scale. Do this at the same time every day. Put the numbers into a spreadsheet and make them into a running chart. You're going to see a line that oscillates seemingly at random for a while. After some time, you'll see a general downward trend. Don't panic about upward swings; your body changes weight within a range every day. We're trying to move the range down.

**What can I expect at different times in the diet?**

- Week 1: Hungry all the time. Dehydrated. Energy levels unpredictable. Possible large amounts of weight loss; this is ""water weight"" or inflammation. Eat when hungry, eat tons of fat, drink lots of water.

- Week 2: Still hungry a lot, carb cravings start to be severe (if they haven't already). You will fantasize about carbs. Dream about them. Don't eat them.

- Week 3: Hunger gets under control. You start to go longer and longer without feeling hungry. Carb cravings hopefully begin to fade.

- Week 4: Hunger should be under control by now. You may not feel hungry for meals you're used to eating. Don't worry about it; if you're not hungry, you don't need to eat. Carb cravings should have subsided to manageable levels by now.

**I don't have time to cook/I eat out a lot/my parents make my food.**

I see this sort of whining all the time. It's nonsense that somehow tries to use laziness as an excuse for failure. If you have time to sit in the drive-through, you have time to nuke pre-cooked chicken and a freezer bag of broccoli with butter. Nearly every restaurant has low-carb food options, even if it involves ordering a sandwich and pitching the bread. Jimmy John's delivers lettuce wraps. Subway, Chipotle, Qdoba, and even most bars have no-compromise delicious low-carb options.

Your parents can cook you healthy food, or you can offer to cook for them. Most parents and family members will be delighted that you're eating healthier, but pitch it as a natural diet rather than keto to avoid the prejudice.

**What if I plateau?**

First, a definition of plateau: No new record low weights in at least a month. I see a lot of people on this sub who panic when they don't lose weight for a few days. Relax. This is a long, noisy process with variation from a number of sources.

If you genuinely plateau, have a hard look at your diet. First, be honest with yourself about adherence. Did you maybe sneak in more cheat food than you thought? Do a food log for a few days if necessary, logging every morsel. If you're okay there, it's time to start counting calories. I don't expect you'll get to this point, but if you do, count calories with a food log for a few days and see how much you're really consuming.

The overarching goal of this diet is to fix your chemical and emotional relationship with food, thereby allowing weight loss without starving yourself. For most, that just means eliminating foods that are habit-forming and that prevent you from getting proper hunger signals. If that's not enough, you may have a deeper problem in your relationship with food that requires time with a therapist.

Keto + Auto Immune (TNF Inhibitor) + PCOS,5,jewqy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jewqy6/keto_auto_immune_tnf_inhibitor_pcos/,9,1603250978.0," 

I feel like I'm on an uphill battle.

My husband, bless his entire being, has done so well on keto and I'm here throwing hail mary after hail mary it feels like. **Last year I went keto with him for about 3 months and only lost 10lbs**. He stuck with it and is over 65lbs down. I celebrate his success every day and he's truly been an inspiration to me. I travel (well, I did pre covid) about 45% for my work, so I found it hard to stick to keto so did not continue on with it. However, I have to do something as I gained all of that weight back and then some. **I've been back doing keto with my hubs since August, so....only 3 months...and again after 3 months, 10lbs lost. At least that shows how slow weight loss is for me.**

**I am a 37yr. old Asian Female with an auto immune disease (Psoriatic Arthritis) on a weekly TNF Inhibitor injection, and have PCOS.** I've struggled my entire life with auto immune type symptoms, have been tested for Lupus but thankfully that came back negative. **TNF Inhibitors and PCOS result in weight gain so losing weight is this uphill battle I speak of.** I work in biopharma so understand how the body ""should"" work.

I feel these macro calculators are for a ""normal"" person? I could be wrong...but I've calculated at:

FAT: 127 grams/72% | Protein: 86 grams/22% | Net Carbs 25 grams/6%

I've strictly stuck to these macros, and I've at times eaten less than 25 grams carbs or 0 on some days to see if that would help the weight loss. I would lie if I didn't say I was not jealous reading other peoples stories of 20lbs lost in a month etc. But, I try and ground myself, remind myself my body is not the same, and to just keep sticking with it.

Keto (besides almost starving myself) has been the only thing that has worked - so I'm sticking with it and have found a groove. I just wish the results would come faster. I know this is a marathon/way of life and not a sprint - but today is a weak day (which I'm allowed to feel).

I do intermittent fasting, I don't east past dinner (around 7:30pm) and next day will eat around 1 or 2pm. Some days if I feel like I can go till dinner, I will just drink some bone broth and just have dinner. In terms of exercise, that is an issue. I'm glued to meetings from 7am every morning till sometimes 10pm at night. I walk around my neighborhood when I have small blocks of time.

Diet consists of the normal keto food items, we've recently incorporated Quest chips into our diet as sports are back and we miss chips but try and avoid these ""keto friendly"" pre processed foods. Husband can tolerate MCT and sugar alcohols, I'm not as lucky. Though I've drop by drop been trying to increase my MCT intake without it throwing me on the ground with stomach pains crying for my Momma :) Small amount of sugar alcohols I'm okay with - but most time I'm on the porcelain throne within the hour so I avoid where possible.

**If there is anyone out there that is also on a similar uphill battle, would love to know what you've had success with.** Or, if you just have words of encouragement, I would love to hear them as well.

Off to check the menstrual cycle and keto reddit....as this has been a bitch for me too....

Keto + Detox diet,0,jeb2hn,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jeb2hn/keto_detox_diet/,2,1603171141.0,"Has anyone tried keto in combination with an “trigger detox” diet?  I.e., eliminating usual culprits to digestive issues and inflammation, (like peanuts, dairy, eggs, gluten, tofu).  

I’ve had success with both methods independently in the past, but not tried both at the same time.  I’d like to go back to the elimination diet again, but I’m about 2 months back into keto, and I’d like to keep it going.  

I don’t anticipate any health related concerns with this, I’m mainly concerned with the logistics of meals.  Typically with keto, I do a lot of meat like pork, fish and chicken, (which are all ok with both diets,) but I also supplement this with ALOT of dairy products (milk, cream, cheese) ALOT of eggs, and meats like pepperoni, no-sugar jerky, and bacon, which are not allowed on the detox (due to additives I think.  Even nitrate-free are no-no’s).  No alcohol.  

I’m not quite sure how to shift and replace those meats, eggs and dairy I’ve been relying on to get my protein met.  

Has anyone done this with success?  If so, how did you start, how long did you do the detox, what results/benefits/drawbacks did you see, and mainly, what did you eat?  

Disclaimer:  before anyone says it, I am using the term “diet” to specifically mean a food/nutrition diet, NOT a weight-loss diet.  I’m aware keto is a lifestyle change, not just a diet.  
 - I want to try this again, bc I’m not having the same results with keto this time around.  I still feel sluggish and cloudy-headed, and bloated.  There’s just something that’s off this time.  Maybe bc i turned 40, idk.  
 - To clarify, I am meaning an “irritation elimination detox” diet, not a detox of alcohol or stored toxins.  

- I currently am doing IF, and CICO, which is fine, but no change.  I **cannot** do OMAD.",1

Keto / WW Blended household,2,jagghi,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jagghi/keto_ww_blended_household/,11,1602633999.0,"Do any of you have any advice for managing a household where my wife (28f) and I (35m) are on different diet plans?

We tried Keto in the past - she hated it, hid her cheat meals, basically did what she wanted, while I loved it, and lost nearly 40lbs.

Life happened, I fell off the train, and now we’re trying again, but down the WW path.  This absolutely works for her (Down 25lbs, and she’s gotten a lot of inspiration from my mom, down over 60).  But now I’m repeating her side from the keto path.  I hate WW - it feels so restrictive and micro-managing... so I’m not putting in any effort.

Is there a way to combine the two to work together, or are we going to be doomed to just eating two different meals forever?  In my experience, nearly everything WW friendly is terrible on the keto side, and vice versa.

&#x200B;

I hit my 60 day mark on keto and, as promised, I'm ready to update you with progress pictures.  All I can say is...what??!!  My face!  =O  The girl in the mirror hasn't noticed any changes but these pictures don't lie.  I'm stunned!

41F, 5'3"", SW 226, CW 207

Month 1:  - 13 lbs

Month 2:  - 6 lbs

Total = down 19 lbs in 2 months!

&#x200B;

Here is my first 30 day post:  [30 days of keto post (with pictures)](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9n3a8b/keto_30_day_before_after_pictures/)

&#x200B;

But to summarize, I started keto as a pretty vocal anti-keto'er.  After a bunch of research on infertility and how the keto diet may help with it, I just had to give it a try.  No baby yet, but wow, the changes are remarkable.  Currently I'm doing about 1/2 lazy keto and 1/2 strict keto, due to how much I travel for work.  1-2 days/week I walk an hour.  That's it.

&#x200B;

Changes I've noticed:

* amazing skin...no more adult acne!
* more energy
* more confidence
* so much more clear-headed and focused
* crazy ass dreams at night!
* plantar fasciitis that I have been struggling with for a year and a half is almost completely gone

&#x200B;

Biggest and most remarkable change is, no binges in 60 days.  This might be a record for me.  In fact, this month things have significantly changed with my eating disorder/food addiction.  Cravings come and I can easily say no.  Hunger comes and it's not a problem to wait it out until my next meal.  Snacking is almost obsolete.  Portion sizes are much smaller and quickly fill me up.  The only struggle I have is that I repeat a lot of food and sometimes I just want more variety.

&#x200B;

IF:  So I thought I would try IF 16:8 this month.  I just don't think this is for me at this time.  The 3rd day, by the time it was time to eat, I was on the edge of a binge trigger.  I could feel it bubbling up.  With my past eating disorders, restriction like that becomes a trigger.  I'm just not at a place yet where I feel confident in myself to do it.

&#x200B;

I posted this in my 30 day post, but I still use it and find it really helpful.  [Here is a 30-day calendar](https://detoxinista.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/30-DAY-GOALS1-1024x976.jpg) to print out and put on your fridge...something very satisfying about marking off each day you complete.  If you are on the fence at all about trying keto, just give it 30 days!

&#x200B;

On to my next round...wish me luck because the holidays are going to be tough!  I've already committed myself to making my own keto-friendly Thanksgiving meal.  I'm too scared that a cheat day will lead to completely falling off the wagon, that's just who I am and I'm not ready yet to give this WOE up yet.

&#x200B;

Best of luck to you all and I'll see you in another 30 days! <3

&#x200B;

Edited to add:  Whoa.  Thank you for all the love - I was not expecting this!  You guys are awesome - thank you for all the great feedback...I'm on cloud 9!  Thank you, thank you!

So finally I decided to try them out with chicken nuggets.

All were fried in peanut oil @ 375 F for approximately 4-5 minutes in a fryer. A little bit of garlic salt and pepper were added to each mix.

1. 2/3 cup **almond flour** + 1/3 cup **parmesan** (the Kraft canned parm)

2. 2/3 cup **flax meal** + 1/3 cup **parmesan** 

3. 1 cup **parmesan**

4. 1 cup **pork rinds** (crushed in a plastic bag with a rolling pin, I don't have a damn food processor, whatever that is)

In the end I just prefer PORK RINDS. Every variation with the parmesan has a mildly cheesy aftertaste. That isn't so bad when you make a crust for a keto pizza but in chicken nugget I do not like to taste cheese. At all.

And this was a legitimate stovetop deep fryer that holds 12 cups of oil. I don't have an air fryer (remember when this was just called a convection oven?) and I don't use a big pot full of oil.

Anyway just my experience",1

Keto Changed Me. It’s My 18th Birthday and Prom’s Tonight.

Originally my goals were to lose >30 pounds by the end of 2017 and >50 by my birthday. Beat both of those goals by about 50 pounds. I did it with keto, intermittent fasting, and extended water fasting (longest I’ve gone is a week). It’s not been super easy, and man I’ve had some real bad setbacks (2 of which were >10 pounds gained), but I’ve just about made it to my goal. Once I get under 200 I plan on hitting the gym hard and putting some carbs in my diet (and a lot of protein) to gain muscle quick. Do that for 5ish months, then shred the rest of the year with keto. I might post again on New Years or something. 
Also a tip: find close friends who can keep you accountable. One of my best friends has kept track of my progress since I started and boy I couldn’t have done it without him. Find people who really want the best for you. 
It’s funny... me and my friends had a running joke “lose the weight for a hot prom date.” Obviously not my only motivation but it gave me something to look forward to. If you asked me then who I’d like to take out of anyone, I would have told you this girl Rachel. Just a few weeks ago me and those friends did a big promposal for Rachel (from me), she says yes, and we’re gonna go on a date after. I don’t think keto has nothing to do with this. Hmmmm. 
But anyway thanks for reading this, KCKO! I’ll respond to all the comments as soon as I can, but today is my birthday and I do have a hot date. 
P.S. I know I look like an idiot with my tongue out in the first pic. And in the other one it looks like I have a really pointy nipple. That’s my arm. Also my hair looks bad cuz I ain’t washing it until right before I pick Rachel up. 

Edit: I’m not gonna just pig out on crap when I hit my goal. I’m talking like a cup of brown rice or sweet potato before and after working out. That’s what most jacked Youtubers say, what my twin brother says (who loves keto and is way more jacked than I), and also what a nutritionist told me who did keto to lose a ton of fat. Also I may or may not follow up with prom pics tomorrow. Maybe if this hits 1000 upvotes I will ;) haha kidding. If I’m feeling it I will. But definitely if it hits 1k. Also my flair now says 18!

Keto Has Saved My Life - Down 100 Pounds In 6 Months,2272,9d75zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9d75zg/keto_has_saved_my_life_down_100_pounds_in_6_months/,157,1536187229.0,"[First Milestone Down - 100 Pounds On Keto](https://imgur.com/a/JykFTE3)

I used to go to bed at night and be ok if I didn’t wake up the next morning. I just knew any day I would just die in my sleep. I had reached the point where I was going to have to rely on my family to do the most basic things. Finally, I decided to ask my wife for help. I didn’t want to die and leave my family alone. She was ready. I was ready. Our daughter was ready. 

We started Keto on March 7, 2018 after watching nearly every video on the Keto Connect YouTube channel. It made sense. We only had to make a few swaps and decide that we needed to go cold turkey on processed foods. And then the weight started falling off. I was able to start doing more. I had more energy. 

We made a pact that we would try for a year to get healthy enough to travel. Three months later we were touring the Black Hills and Mount Rushmore. Then Rocky Mountain National Park. Then Sequoia National Park and King’s Canyon. Now we want to hit every National Park before the year is up. 

We’ve joined a gym and continue to learn how to optimize our bodies. Keto may not be for everyone but it has saved my life. Everyday people ask me what I am doing. When I tell them, they say that they can’t commit to that. They say it’s a fad. I tell them it’s a lifestyle and I can’t see any other way to take back the life that I had been denying myself. 

I finally hit my 100 pounds lost in 6 months. My current goal is 35 more. My ultimate goal is 300 pounds lost. I’m just going to take it one day at a time.

# Crust:

* 2 cups Almond Flour
* 1/3 cup Butter (melted)
* 3 tbsp Erythritol (Swerve Brown Sugar)
* 1 tsp Vanilla Extract
* Pinch of Salt
* Few drops of water (as needed if the dough is too crumbly)

\*\*Combine flour, erythritol, and salt. Combine with melted butter and vanilla extract. The dough will be crumbly but should stick together more or less. Add a few drops of water to help with cohesion if necessary. Press into 9"" springform pan lined with parchment paper. Bake at 350F for 15 minutes or until the crust becomes golden brown. Remove and let cool for at least 10 minutes before adding cheesecake filling.\*\*

&#x200B;

# Filling:

* 32 oz. Cream Cheese (softened, room temperature) - **DO NOT MICROWAVE!**
* 1 cup Erythritol (Regular/Granulated/Powdered)
* 4 Eggs (large) - Room Temperature
* Juice/Zest 1 (large) Lemon
* 1 tsp Vanilla Extract

\*\*Combine eggs, lemon juice/zest, erythritol, and vanilla extract in a bowel. Whisp thoroughly to dissolve erythritol. Dissolving the erythritol in this step will avoid 'crunchiness' in the cheesecake filling. In a second large bowl, fold in the egg mixture in 4 portions. If you use a hand mixer, keep the speed at low to avoid overworking the filling. The filling should be silky and smooth. Add lemon cheesecake filling to 9"" springform pan and crust. Place in a water bath and bake at 325F for 1 hr 15 min. (Will vary with oven, etc. The cheesecake should be firm at the edges but still jiggly in the middle when removed from the oven). Remove from the oven after baking, allow to cool on the counter before wrapping in plastic and refrigerating for at least 4 hours to allow for a complete set. Use a butter knife to loosen edges and remove from the springform pan.\*\*

&#x200B;

Changes from Wholesome Yum:

So, the changes from the recipe include the addition of salt and substitution of brown Swerve as the sweetener in the crust. This achieves a more ""Graham Cracker"" look and taste. I also increased the egg count, added juice/zest from a whole lemon, and dissolved the erythritol in the liquid component of the filling. This method allows the use of granular erythritol without those unpleasant crunchy bits of undissolved sweetener. I also think this technique provides a smoother, silkier filling.

I've tried multiple sweeteners. I'd recommend avoiding Stevia containing products. Even good blends tend to leave a weird, bitter aftertaste. I think the sheer quantity of required sweetener and the subtle flavors of a lemon and vanilla cheesecake might predispose Stevia products to taste weird.

Hopefully, this helps other novice bakers trying to get their sweet fix on keto!

Keto Round 2 - Holiday Help,3,jbgvn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jbgvn0/keto_round_2_holiday_help/,7,1602765044.0,"I started keto in May 2019. I am 6’3” and weighed 325 an all time high. My fiancé had our baby and a month later I had an hospital scare. I lived the keto lifestyle for 7 months, losing 66 pounds. I had better sleep, and my ADHD, anxiety, and depression improved. I felt great and people noticed my weight loss.

Then... Thanksgiving happened. My favorite dessert called my name... I couldn’t resist having a pumpkin pie. I kept telling myself I cannot be weak. I cannot be another person that posts on Reddit regarding a keto reboot.... I failed, failed real hard. I had that pumpkin pie. Then I slowly started to eat more carbs. Then Christmas happened, I gave in and stopped counting carbs and ate what I wanted. With eating countless carbs and paired with quarantine I gained 31 pounds and my mental health got real bad... I kept telling my self the weight I regained is probably half water weight. Thinking...I didn’t gain that much weight. From July - August, I tried to go back to keto, but I couldn’t give up my desserts... I had a mentality of “I’ll start keto tomorrow.”Clothes were not fitting anymore, and I could tell I have gained so much weight. 

In September, I knew I had to do something about my health again. Keto was the only thing I knew that helped me lose weight in the past. I randomly got up from my couch, and threw all bad carbs out of my kitchen. 

Within a month into keto 2.0, I am down 16 pounds and am exercising everyday (which I didn’t do last time I did keto). I thought to myself that 16 pounds sounds minimal compared to last time. However, since I am exercising more I think I am actually losing more body fat and gaining more muscle. Clothes that were tight on me are now loose. I feel amazing again :) 

I hope this post can help motivate someone do a keto reboot 2.0. All it takes is that first step and from there it gets easy. My only advise is to REMEMBER... NEVER TRUST A KETO FART. I may have shitted myself more than my 1 year old daughter within the 1st week.

For the people that had a strong mind and will during the holiday season, how did you overcome all of the yummy desserts on table? 

Tl;dr - Did keto for 7 months and went from 325 to 259 (66 pounds). Stopped doing keto for 7 months and gained 31 pounds. Started keto again and lost 16 pounds. How did y’all overcome all of the yummy desserts during the holiday season?

Keto Saved Our Lives. Combined 200 lbs LOST! [Pics],1460,8aav9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/8aav9h/keto_saved_our_lives_combined_200_lbs_lost_pics/,108,1523060413.0,"Pics - https://imgur.com/a/PS8Ka

About 3 years ago my wife stumbled onto this Keto thing and frankly we regarded it the same way we did every other diet program. We'd tried it all: 4 Hour Body, 5 Bite, Low Fat this and that, cabbage, Soup, everything. Why would we assume that Keto was any different?

So we sat on it, even though my wife bought the Ketonix stick. We sat, waited, and stuffed ourselves with all sorts of horrible foods that made us in turn feel miserable. Every meal was followed by a lengthy meat sweats session and a debilitating ""heavy"" feeling.

We hated ourselves for allowing our eating habits to ruin our lives. We never left the house, rarely took pictures, and our relationship suffered immensely. 

Then we tried Keto and, sure, it was a little dodgy at first. We had to figure out how it worked and where our carb limits were, but then we discovered a few low carb stores in our area and suddenly life wasn't so different. I believe that's what made it click for us. We weren't rolling up slices of lunch meat and cheese- there were sandwiches. i could make tacos with low carb tortillas and hot dogs on actual hot dog buns. 

So here we are- my wife has been keto for 15 months and I just passed my year (I wasn't quite sold on it until I saw her success. She's amazing, by the way!) and we've lost a combined 200 LBS!

Keto has given me control of my life. I feel like I finally understand  what my body needs. I'm so grateful for that and to you guys for your stories, your support, and your advice. We've learned so much from your mistakes and victories. Thank you so all.",1

Keto Will Be Mainstream After 2020,2800,84ilua,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/84ilua/keto_will_be_mainstream_after_2020/,572,1521104385.0,"In case you haven't [heard](https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm598808.htm), the FDA's new [Nutrition Facts labels](https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm385663.htm) are to be enforced by 2020.

There are many outstanding and healthful changes they are making:

1. They are removing the ""Calories from fat"" section. They correctly explain that there is not evidence that the entry provides any useful health information.

2. They are enforcing new portion size increases. For example, ice cream is normally a 1/2 cup, but now it will be reported as 2/3 cup per serving because this more accurately reflects what most people actually consume.

3. Foods that can reasonably be consumed in one eating occasion must list the nutrition facts for the entire package/bottle as one serving.

4. ***Here is the most significant part*** - A new ""Added sugars"" section, with a DV% set to 50g. That means that many drinks, sweets, and more, will have upwards of 50% per serving! Even crossing 100% in many cases!

Some of these labels are already starting to appear today. I believe that once we cross requirement day in 2020, and leading up to it, more and more people will become educated about sugar. From that, I think it's only natural that many will also learn about keto. Keto is steadily soaring in the research and medical community, and it is only a matter of time before mainstream physicians and nutritionists have to accept facts and science.",1

"Keto and Alcohol - Don't, just don't.",1,wi08d,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/wi08d/keto_and_alcohol_dont_just_dont/,8,1342218393.0,"I'm hoping this thread gets found by those of you searching for Keto and alcohol, or ""can I drink on this diet"" I've been on Keto for 3 months so far, had a couple of cheat meals early on, but they gave me headaches so I quit - I've been sticking to the diet, restricting my calories, using MFP, the lot. I've even got to the gym a time or two as well. 

I have a pretty stressful job and lifestyle, so one thing I do to unwind is drink. Not get hammered drunk - just usually a couple of glasses of scotch on the couch before bed, or a few vodka/diet cokes on the weekend. I drink pretty much every evening to unwind.

My weight loss was quick at first, but it stalled around 250. For the last 8 weeks its been slowly declining at just under a pound a week, not this magic 3-4 pounds a week that everyone else seems to be experiencing. The only thing I hadn't cut from my diet was my beloved alcohol. :-/ Well, looking at the scale the other morning sitting at 243 and getting more and more tired of not seeing that ""23x"" number, I decided to cut it cold turkey. I haven't had a drink, since last Saturday, so almost 6 days of clean eating (as usual) drinking lots of water (as usual) and drinking no alcohol. I've been busy so I haven't been to the gym at all this week.

I weigh at the same time every weigh in and in the same state - fresh out of the shower, first thing in the morning. Finally! This morning I saw I'd bust through my plateau! weighed in at 239.2 down from 243.0 six days ago! So in conclusion: 

Can you lose weight drinking alcohol? Yes
Will you lose more weight if you don't drink? Absolutely!

I'm gonna stay off the booze completely for a few weeks (I have a birthday coming up soon) Then after my birthday, probably just limit it to the occasional Saturday.

In wanting to avoid statins I began to look inflammation as the cause of heart disease, not cholesterol.  I knew high GI carbs were bad, inflammatory, so already tried to consume less, but it was after I found out I was essentially pre-diabetic that I began to eat HFLC.  Labs just prior to this doubling down on reducing carbs and not being afraid of more good fat, heavy cream in coffee, etc., left me with slightly lower cholesterol, but my triglycerides went up and my HDL went down.  My TG:HDL ratio was still ok but over 1.  My understanding is that this ratio is more strongly predictive of coronary artery disease.

At any rate, I really went whole hog LCHF and was eating eggs, cheese, avocados, olive oil, butter and sour cream like crazy.  Just had my labs done and my total and LDL are up again but my TG and HDL flip flopped - HDL increased and TG decreased so my ratio is about 0.5 again!  

I've seen Dr. Paul Mason talk about his patient with horrificly high cholesterol and LDL, but he's a super fit super low BMI muscle bound athlete with an awesome TG:HDL ratio.  I'm choosing to not worry about this!

Read a lot about keto! So i understand now that fat isn't all that bad, but im still confused with keto and vegetables. I just find it hard to believe that eating carrots or other carby type of vegetables to be of hindrance to keto and weightloss in general. Thing is ive never heard of a study or even a report of someone saying their weightloss was unsuccessful because of eating vegetables. Fruit, yeah kind of because they can sometimes be high in calories and stuff. Vegetables not so much.

So people say to avoid them (carby vegetables) doing the keto diet because you dont want to get bumped out of the ketosis state. But has anyone here personally had that problem? More importantly, did it even affect you? Did you get hungrier than usual or something?? Consider that it might have just been a placebo. Placebos are real! Ironic hehe.

I want to follow this, well, lifestyle i guess you guys would call it because i do enjoy the taste of fat myself. Its probably my favourite macronutrient.

Why not just restrict carbohydrates for weight loss/blood sugar control?,8,1kawsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1kawsy/keto_can_be_unhealthy_why_not_just_restrict/,221,1376455375.0,"I am in my fourth year studying nutrition biochemistry and dietetics (yes I know many of you hate dietitians but hear me out!). First of all I want to clear up a few misconceptions about dietitians. 

1. We are not allowed to be as flexible and ""cutting edge"" with our nutrition advice as say, a fitness or keto forum is, because simply we have more liability by working directly with patients and thus HAVE to have solid research behind everything we recommend.  I feel like many people do not understand this and quickly disregard dietitians for preaching ""old school nutrition"".

2. Having said that, I do believe that we are in the middle of a ""nutrition revolution"" of sorts where the long taught high carb low fat diet will be slowly (and already are) replaced with recommendations of low carb diets. This is because there is solid research that controlling blood sugar levels and therefore controlling insulin production can kickstart fat burning and weight loss. The evidence is becoming so strong that even the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (the largest dietitian organization who has sponsors that include big processed food companies) is reluctantly recommending such a strategy 
http://andevidencelibrary.com/topic.cfm?cat=3014&auth=1.

3. However, I do believe that self inducing ketosis is not an ideal diet because eating plans should serve two goals: induce healthy weight loss and promote healthy eating practices for life, I believe that /r/keto is only accomplishing the weight loss part of the equation and I will explain in the next few bullets.

* Fruit is healthy. Fruits contain many cancer fighting properties, nutrients, slow down the aging process and contain a lot of fiber which can improve cholesterol, blood sugar, colon cancer risk, constipation, etc.  Do I need to post studies for this one?

* A high fat diet can lead to bad food choices. The jury is still not out on saturated fats correlation to heart disease http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat_and_cardiovascular_disease_controversy, cured meats like bacon are heavily processed and contain harmful additives. Here is one review on the matter: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18444144. Cured meats also contain a lot of sodium which is still strongly linked to hypertension http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23558163


* The brain prefers carbohydrates. Although a ketogenic diet has been shown to be an effective therapy against various brain diseases, there is currently not enough research to determine if the brain suffers in function by relying on ketone bodies, with decreased concentration being a frequently cited effect.

* Contrary to the faq, protein based foods (eggs/meat/fish/tofu/cheese) will NOT raise your blood sugar to any significant degree. In fact, understanding this principle is paramount to controlling diabetes.

Again, I think a lot of information on this board is great and it is resassuring that people are becoming skeptical on current dietary recommendations (food company lobbying anyone?). However I believe that simply restricting carbohydrates to about <45 grams per meal is sufficient to see great weight loss while not comprising your health and will power.

**TL;DR: Based on available research, I believe a low carb diet is better for long term health than a keto diet**

**Edit: Well that was interesting, thanks for everyone who participated in the debate. I hope you all felt that sometimes debating something you are passionate about can be healthy. I stand by my words but also learned a lot about the culture and benefits surrounding the ketogenic diet. Thank you.**

 I started the keto diet at the end of august, and have, in comparison, reduced a mass amount of carbs and sugars from my diet. I may not always be able to keep it under 20, but Ive managed to keep it under 35 this whole time. An average of 25 grams of carbs a day.

Keto did not work for me,1,6pyx7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/6pyx7q/keto_did_not_work_for_me/,29,1501217371.0,"Long story short; I noticed some benefits: my acne cleared up, and brain fog cleared up to some extent. But toward the end, it was not working. I had no energy to exercise-- At first I could still do my daily 5 mile run, toward the end I couldn't even run a block; I had no energy. I ate more and more every day, which made me unbelievably tired-- and I gained weight.

All in all, I did for about 2.5 weeks, and I got more tired every day. Eventually I caved and bought a bag of doritos, and as I'm sure everybody on here can guess -- it was all over very quickly from there.

This was a few months ago. I have been reflecting on it, and there is no doubt that I noticed some real benefits from keto, and now I am considering the possibility that maybe I didn't give it enough time. I had/have metabolic syndrome, AKA an excess of insulin/insulin resistance, and maybe during adjustment, I will have to gain some weight at first while the insulin forces my body to eat more than is good for me, but that insulin levels will decline in the absence of carbohydrates, and the calorie imbalance will eventually correct.

So I guess I'm looking for any thoughts/suggestions. Are there people for whom keto does not work? Any T2 diabetics(or others) here who had a very difficult time adjusting, but who eventually started to get benefits?

Face to face, with a c. 35lbs loss. The photos from my friends wedding on the left, lead me to starting keto. I was horrified by how fat I looked in them. I'm down around 35lbs, but progress has been much slower than all the success stories you normally hear. It's taken me a year. I only lose about 0.5lbs a week now in a good week. But changing my relationship with food has been the biggest success. 10 more lbs and I will have officially gone from obese to a healthy weight! I'm not at goal yet, but I'm getting closer!

Don't give up x

EDIT: Wow, so this blew up much more than I was ever anticipating. Thank you ALL for your kind words. I'm genuinely taken aback by how kind and inspiring you all have been, it really has given me the confidence to keep on pushing. I thought I'd address some of the more commonly asked questions, since there are now so many comments!!

Yes, I f'd up my maths. I'm from Scotland and not used to working in lbs as measurement, I've lost 35lbs and was 200lbs when at my heaviest. This is also embarrassing since I am a mathematician 😂.

Yes, I DID wear that to my friends wedding. It's very pale pink and a stunning floor length lace dress. We realllly dress up in Scotland for weddings. Plus, I was maid of honour and the bride chose the dress, soooo get your knickers out of a twist. Besides my friend is absolutely smokin' there was no way I could ever ""upstage"" her.

I have taken a similar approach to my own wedding which is next year, I want my bridesmaids to look and feel amazing!! My wedding in May is my ultimate goal for getting to goal. 

My fiance has been super supportive of the keto journey, but doesn't need to lose weight but knows its important to me. He comes on and off with me when he has been indulgent and wants to slim down, but also he likes to cook. He says he likes a bit of junk in the trunk and has never ""seen"" my weight, I do believe him.

Treating my relationship with carbs and sugar as an addiction has been a monumental mindset shift. Check out the carb addiction doc on YouTube. Everything he says really resonated with me. I realise that I can't moderate my carb intake, when I try diets that require this, they ultimately fail. I can however, cut them out completely with much greater success!!

To all my slow losers out there, I understand your struggle!! But slow and steady really does win the race. Even if the scales haven't budged, you're in a better place than if you had given up. Just keep going!!! I do IF from dinner til lunch.

I have fallen off the wagon and ""cheated"", usually where alcohol is involved, so I am trying to cut back on this too. However, I'm Scottish and this much easier said than done. I also went to Italy and ate all the carbs, because Italy?? I didn't regret this, and got straight back on keto when I got home.

Thank everyone, I actually weighed in this morning and only lost 0.25lbs this week 😭 but I will not let it get me down :)

Lots of love

I went to the doctors and had my yearly blood test done about 2 weeks ago - everything came back in normal range and had pretty much great results. This Monday he measured my blood pressure which was a bit higher at that point but I've been measuring it the last few days and it's been rather normal. I told him all about my journey with keto and how I had lost almost 20 kg in those 2.5 months and he said it could be related but still sent me for a ENT check on Monday, so we'll see how that turns out.

I'm ""mostly vegan"" keto - vegan except for daily fish oil supplements and 1-2x/ week wild-caught fatty fish or organic, pasture-raised egg. I track my blood glucose and ketone levels daily and can confidently tell you that all the cravings for pizza and bagels pass around month 5 of being fully fat-adapted.

There's no doubt that conventional medicine is the reason that I'm alive. Nevertheless, a ketogenic diet rich with nutrition combined with fasting, meditation and yoga are why I feel better than I ever have despite the tumors still in my lung, brain, liver, and about a dozen lymph nodes.

I'm part of a clinical trial proving the benefits of metabolic therapies like keto for cancer and one of a new generation of cancer patients outliving their ""standard of care"" prognoses thanks to this way of eating.

I had a DXA scan done at the request of my nutritionist and I'm down 50lb and from who knows how much fat to 25.0% body fat and ""good lean muscle mass.""  I didn't tell the practitioner about my diagnosis and his only comments were to work on my symmetry and that I must have a good diet :-)

Over the course of the past 6 months, I have been on a relatively strict keto diet (most days under 30 g of carbs) and added in calorie restriction as well. I also keep my alcohol consumption at a minimum and eat out very infrequently (if I do eat out, I always choose a place with a salad).

I started doing keto in late August and since then have come across some items in British stores that have made the diet much more enjoyable. Thought I might share it with you guys!

**Bread:** At 3.8 carbs per slice with a lovely granary bread like taste, it is the best supermarket option you can get without costing a fortune. At £1.50 it is much cheaper than Keto bread sold elsewhere or making it yourself (which for me is not an option working full time and struggling as it is to find time for everything).

**Icecream:** Sainsbury's and Waitrose sell in store Ice lollies that are keto friendly. At 3.5 carb per lolly they are creamy as the main ingredient is Greek yogurt. They are mini, but due to the low carb count you can easily have 2-3 of them and still be in ketosis.

**Cappuccino:** Pret a Manger use provamel for their soya alternative. Provamel is fantastic as it zero carb for soya and almond milk and has a high fat content. It frothes well and honestly I will probably permanently order soya cappuccinos from Pret as I enjoy them more than the standard offering.

If you are not near a pret, I normally order a cappuccino with the request that it is half soya and half whole milk, as it will produce a creamy texture with much less carbs.",1

Keto has taught me that I have a substance abuse problem,1757,7yxal5,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7yxal5/keto_has_taught_me_that_i_have_a_substance_abuse/,357,1519173703.0,"Sorry for the click bait title. I often get asked how much weight I'll lose before I'll allow myself to eat sweets and breads again. One thing I'm learning is that the problem always has been and always will be sugar.  To say that the reason I got heavy is because, on a daily basis, I consumed more calories than I burned is factually true...... but if we stop there then we're entirely missing what for me was the real problem.  Freakin' sugar.

I never realised how much the need to get sugar in my body dominated my life until I quit consuming it.  When I walked into the break room and saw doughnuts I didn't eat 3 of them because I was hungry.  I was almost never hungry in the morning so I ate them to fulfill some need other than hunger.  When I said, ""There's nothing more refreshing than an ice cold Coca-Cola on a hot day"" my brain was actually saying, ""There's nothing more refreshing than a bunch of sugar at any given time.""  When I ate an entire brick of oreos with a tall glass of milk in the evening, it wasn't because I was simply craving something sweet.  It was because sugar helped to replace some bad feeling(depression, anxiety, loneliness )with a good feeling.  It was a coping mechanism.  

And the more sugar and simple carbs I consumed the more I wanted it the next time.  When I ate plates of pasta and drank 5 cans of coke a day it wasn't food that I was after or thirst I was quenching .... it was sugar.  I have an addiction to sugar. Two big bowls of ice cream in one sitting, an entire Little Ceasars pizza, an entire bag of Dorritos.... all mechanisms to get my next fix. And the exposure to this ""drug"" can be overwhelming. Next time you're in a grocery store take note of how many aisles you don't even need to go down because you already know there's nothing good for you there.  What percentage of a grocery store is off limits to a ketoer? 75%?

I'm not trying to downplay the severity of other drugs that are abused and wreak havoc on people's lives.  Sugar compared to hard drugs and alcohol are not on the same plane when it comes to their destructive power. But the insight of knowing what effect sugar has on me is important.  When people ask me when I'll eat sugar again I think to myself that I won't eat sugar again for the same reason an alcoholic won't say, ""I'm just going to quit for a year, after that I'll be fine to drink again."" This is a new way of life for me. Keto is about taking back control of the power sugar has over me.  

Just wanted to share, thanks for reading. 

Edit: I've had a few people post that sugar is indeed as destructive as hard drugs. Maybe I should have noted that hard drugs tend to be more immediately destructive and disruptive than the long term ramifications of sugar. I didn't want my comparison to be insensitive to people who are going through or no someone dealing with a hard drug addiction.",1

Most keto ice cream requires Erythritol sweetener or similar which is the main cause of rock hard flaky ice cream if you freeze it overnight.

Anyone have tried this method?

**Flavor issue with no-churn and some recipe:**

I do not have an ice cream machine (planning to get one in the near future). Tried a few no-churn recipes where they use whipping cream/heavy cream as the base then adding sweetener and flavors to it...

Keto is just not doing it for me...is there something I'm missing?,0,jcuaaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jcuaaf/keto_is_just_not_doing_it_for_meis_there/,13,1602966561.0,"Really hoping this community can shed some light on this..

These are the things that still bother me on keto:

  \-I haven't been able to workout. At all. Cramps, fatigue, headaches only allow me to endure very short workouts (2 exercises, 4 sets each) on alternate days and that's it. If I try doing it back to back I die.

  \- I can stay awake throughout the day, I feel a relatively constant flow of energy, although I'm not really motivated to do anything and my day is filled with brain fog and passing time. If something happens that require immediate action, I can get an appropriate response quick and I do feel my verbal fluency goes up on stress times, but that's it. After the external stress input, my brain goes back to being a potato.  

This is my background:

  \-Goal: Increase and stabilize my energy levels and performance, metal and physical  (I'm not giving a damn about loosing weight right now)

  \-28y male, usually 8-12% BF and working out 3-4 times a week

  \-Caffeine+Theanine 100-300mg/200-600mg per day or black coffee 1-3 cups a day

  \-IF for 2 years ( Started with 2pm-6 pm 2MAD which evolved to 6pm OMAD then as of today I'm either  2-pm-6pm 2MAD or 6am,2pm,6pm 3MAD, keeping the first meal as small and as carb-less as possible)

  \-Keto-ish for 35 days (Went on 20-30 total carbs for a week, then 20-30 net carbs for another week, and these days I'm doing 30-50 net carbs. Had 3 carb up days in this period.) Either maintenance calories or a 200-300 surplus (exclusevly raised by fat). 

These are the things I've tried and the outcomes:

  \-Electrolytes: I've tried 3000-9000mg of  Na per day, 1000-4500 K per day, through marine salt and lite salt, mostly added to water or ketorade-style drinks during my fasting period and some added to my dinner. Mg constant, 260-390 per day, morning, noon and night. Potassium seems to make my cramps better, lowers my anxiety, Sodium kinda brings me back from the land of the dead and I start feeling more alive. Still these effect are extremely short. I just feel that whatever I put into my body just go straight down the drain and unless I wanna drink a bag of salt a day I don't thing this is going to work. Also tried salting my dinner until I felt weird like my body didn't want any more salt. Felt good. But the morning after, feels like my body is struggling to elevate the pressure, and if I do any exertion I'd get cramps.

  \-Food choices: No I'm not going for the treats. All home made, veggie-rich meals. Coconut oil, Olive oil, MCT. Eggs, sardines, lean meats, chicken breast, thights, legs, avocados, spinach, eggplant, carrots, you name it...nuts, peanut butter. If any I may use erythritol like 5-10g on a few days. Only thing I'm not going for is that pasture-raised, grass fed stuff, but I doubt this would change the game that much for me.

  \-Carbs: As already mentioned, I already messed around with my net carbs a bit, while keeping it on ""keto"" range, had some weeks of pretty strict keto (20-30 total carbs) budgeting veggies, doing carb up days w healthy carbs and once I had a tbsp of honey after/before the workout. None of it seemed helpful.

  \-Hydration: I used to be a compulsive water drinker. After learning about electrolyte waste I reduced my water intake and drank to thirst only. Nothing amazing happened.

I think it's funny when people talk bad about keto, as if eating just meat and vegetables is some crazy thing as if humans haven't been doing that for hundreds of thousands of years... When you think about it, your choice a few thousands years ago was to either kill an animal, or find some vegetables or fruits growing out of the ground. Sure some vegetables and fruits have carbs and sugar, but even eating that it still isn't close to the average level of carbs we consume today. Some people just ate mainly meat. I think some people are just scared to do any diet that seems unfamiliar to them yet have no problem shoving a McDonald's quarter pounder with a M&M McFlurry down their throats.",1

I tried quitting countless times without success. And of course drinking a bottle of wine every night contributed heavily to my weight gain. But then I started keto and without the carbs in my body, my tolerance dropped to 1-2 drinks max that would then give me killer hangovers and make me feel so shitty. So I stopped. I'm no longer a daily drinker -- I don't even feel the urge to drink. It feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

Somehow I get to really deeply enjoy food more than I ever have, but this is somehow making me healthier and healthier. By eating absurdly delicious food to satiety I've gone below my high school weight, am effortlessly maintaining and just look better and better each month. Mental health is fantastic -- tons of focus and memory improvements, I sleep better (and need less), plenty of energy whenever I need it, stable mood, etc.

Digestive issues, heartburn, and allergies somehow are just completely gone.

Somehow I've achieved all this by eating the best food I've ever had over and over, as much as I want (usually not much, I fill up quick these days). Food that doesn't make me tired, sick, or bloated afterwards. It feels like a combination of indulgent comfort food and feel-better health food. Also I legitimately can't eat too much even if I want to -- there's a shutoff switch and then I just don't want food again for 6-8 hours.

Then there's the fact that vegetables taste like fruit used to. Dark leafy greens taste awesome, dark chocolate tastes sweet (and rich) instead of bitter. Tomatoes are like oranges, cucumber is like watermelon, bell peppers are like apples.

I have yet to count or restrict calories. I started at 300, lost almost *HALF* my weight eating just the fattiest most indulgent foods imaginable.

This hasn't been anything like a diet experience at all. I'm not hungry, don't feel restricted, don't feel tempted by non-diet foods.

I am in USA and she is in Canada. Even from here, I was seeing her going to bad to worst. 
She was in such a bad shape that the doctors were just feeding her pills (19 per days) and let her in her misery. She had the by-pass surgery 1 year ago and it didn't help her at all - lost 10lbs, diabetes still really high, pancreas disease, fat liver disease, high pressure, hypothyroid and more. All diseases linked to her PCOS.  She's 59, sedentary, depressed and all the diets she tried never worked.  She was a smoker for 40 years and even did quit,  trying to help herself and get that supposedly miracle surgery.  She was freaking out since our mom died at 65 from the same conditions.  The clock was ticking in her head.

My own condition worsened and I was starting to show all the same sign as her even younger, so I was seeing my future in her and our mom.  Short story, I found Keto, changed my life for the better and begged her to give herself a chance too and try it.  And she did. She really did.  Nothing to lose, gonna die anyway attitude.

She said that we never had the same diet (I was into nutrition, health, Pyramid etc) and that my veggies didn't save me? How can bacon save us?  She had no right to eat lot of keto stuff according to her nutritionist post-surgery, that I was insane to even tell her to try.  She did anyway.

And dang did it works. She is down to 2 pills per day (still waiting on her cholesterol level and her thyroid to drop those maybe), her blood level are healthy, no more pressure, you know, all the benefits of Keto kicking in and giving us hope for her.

This friday, out of sudden, her leg started to bloat and she had to go to the ER.  They told her she had a thrombosis and were scare that it will be in her lung. They did test on her, found out that the blood clots was stuck in her left leg and did act on it right away.

If that would have happen few weeks ago, before Keto, she wouldn't even know she had it, she was use to be bloated, not able to walk and to the pain. She wouldn't have act on it right away. She was feeling so much hell what is a bit more, right?  But with Keto, she is so active, so much healthier that she did notice.  The doctor were able to eliminate real quick the possible cause since her healthy lifestyle did made a change and no more pills side-effect to consider.  They acted quick, even one doctor told her to keep doing Keto and that even if he wasn't well educated about it, he was impressed by her results in a so short time.  

She called me from the hospital and told me I saved her life. I didn't. She did. By taking a huge leap of faith and giving up everything she knew and learned a new WOE.  Proud of her.  I have hope that she will go over her fear of 65 now.   And btw, she is down 20lbs (185lbs)!  Way to go! 

I can't be more grateful to this community and to the youtubers that fed me so much information, inspiration, motivation and knowledge.  Keto is doing more than helping us lose weight, it is saving our life. I'm a believer 100%.

P.S.  She doesn't speak English so I have to translate/explain everything to her but I keep sending her post from here, story that you guys share, lot of you went where she was and it is incredibly helpful so keep sharing please!!!! We need it.
P.S.2 I was really annoying her with electrolyte, potassium, magnesium, sodium etc.  She told that to her doctor. He told her to let me know that I can calm down, her potassium is higher by 2 than normal.  I am calming down with my spinach, I promise. :D",1

My weight loss has slowed down significantly since hitting my last big milestone (125 lbs down) in January. It's taken me 3 months to lose 15 lbs -- which I admit isn't horrible, except I *had* been losing about 13 lbs a month at the beginning of my journey! February and March saw a total of 5 lbs down, while I've lost 10 in April.

I know what was slowing me down, and it really comes down to not paying enough attention to what I've been eating. I wasn't eating enough fat, so I was finding myself to be more hungry between meals and in turn snacking too often. While I was eating keto friendly meals and snacks, I was pushing my carbs and eating a lot of low fat snacks (like protein bars, and other low carb ""treats"") and constantly going far over my recommended calorie intake.

It went like that for most of February and March, and finally in April I started paying closer attention to my fat intake and carbs again. Once I was eating enough fat I was once again not as hungry throughout the day, and I snacked less frequently. I also decided to make my meals higher in calories (and fat) to keep me full longer, which meant less snacking as well.

If you hit a slowdown I highly recommend you reevaluate what you're eating. Pay attention to everything again, like you did when you first started!

Anyway, I've been in maintenance for a year, slowly introducing more and more carbs until eventually I was eating flour-battered fried fish (cos the flour is just on the *outside*, right? It's not like bread, where the middle is flour, right?) I re-joined the winning team to shed off the ten kilos I put on.

Has anyone noticed this? I mean, it's not a huge problem, I could just buy a single sod and patch it over. In fact, maybe this is more of a complain-brag (whoa leg day was sooo tough I barely squatted 325) and I'm kinda proud that my keto-piss has such potency.

"Keto pro tip: The point of keto is to eat food that satisfies and gives you energy without triggering the urge to eat more. If you are eating keto compliant foods that are causing you to binge, they may be hurting your weight loss efforts.",2155,gsxb1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/gsxb1m/keto_pro_tip_the_point_of_keto_is_to_eat_food/,273,1590802293.0,"Ok lads so here is a bit of a harsh truth.  Keto works as a weight loss aid largely because it helps deal with hunger and energy while removing the quick dopamine hit that drug-like edible things cause.  Of course there are other benefits regarding inflammation, auto-immune diseases and so forth but I'm going to stick with weight loss here.

There are many foods that are low in carbs that trigger binge eating in people who are prone to binge eating.  Keto cheesecake is great but not if you cannot stop eating it once you start.  While it may not cause the same blood sugar roller coaster that a sugar-laden dessert would, eating 2000 calories of cream cheese on top of the rest of your food that day is one reason many people stall.

Ask yourself this:  When I eat a thing, am I more hungry or less hungry after eating it?  If you are more hungry or the same level of hungry, consider removing it from your diet.

For me, the triggers are sweet things and roasted salted nuts.  I can easily eat a pound of macadamia nuts in one go.

Remember that junk food is still junk food even if it has better macros, and that keto treatos should be something that is an ""In case of emergency break glass"" sort of thing, or at the very least a special occasion treat!

This is not meant as a bashing post, but why why why can you not convert to metric. 

Recipes mentioning cups, quarts, pounds, ounces, and tablespoons are the absolute worst. They are simply not useful, replicable units of measurement that are a hold out of times when people did not have accurate weight measurements available to them. 

A cup of flour, is that compacted? Heaped? Dependent on humidity? Dependent on type of flour/brand? 

How about a cup of olives?

"Keto veteran, back after pregnancies, morbidly obese yet always been very slow loser even with extreme deficit",4,jb2pud,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jb2pud/keto_veteran_back_after_pregnancies_morbidly/,42,1602717796.0,"This is such a nebulous question, I hesitate to even ask because I've been around long enough to know all the go-to answers. 

Short version - I am 452lbs, I restarted keto 3 weeks ago. I saw a 10lb drop of water weight in the first 3 days then nothing since. I eat 1200-1700 calories a day *happily, by choice*. I am not struggling with this, I am not worried about burnout.  I am also not losing.  

Background - I'm a keto veteran. I lost 86lbs in ~10 months in 2015/2016 then got pregnant after 3+ years of trying w/ some infertility help.  Restarted on my daughter's 1st birthday with the plan to lose 100lbs by her second, then a few months in I ovulated on my own (likely due to weight loss) and got unexpectedly pregnant again.  Our second was born Feb 2019.  

I am not trying to: fatlogic my way out of here, make excuses, argue for ""starvation mode"" or anything similar. I know that it took awhile to gain the weight and will take awhile to lose it.  I fully understand that this is a process and I trust the process.  I was successful before and I know that tiny blips on the scale will eventually add up just as they did before.  I ate at this same deficit last time.  I'm not going to give up so it doesn't really *matter* why I lose slowly, but it is frustrating, right? Surely you can see that. 

I do: weight all my food, supplement with electrolytes, avoid ""faux foods"", track everything in MFP, fast 18:6.  I have recent blood work, thyroid function has been tested, A1C is consistently 5.1-5.9 over the past few years.  I am treating this like sobriety and there are no slip-ups. I genuinely enjoy keto and just accept that its my path.  I have bebopped around due to pregnancies over the last few years, but otherwise my mind is right. I have 24/7 accountability by being self-employed and always with someone, so there are no cheats or lies. 

How can a 450lb person eat ~1600 cal a day on average and just not drop the weight consistently?  I KNOW that comparison is the thief of joy and I'm not looking for these wildly impressive 90lb in 3 month losses.  I KNOW that its just calories in/calories out. I don't think I'm the magical exception to that.  But it just doesn't make sense.  All the facts point to me doing something wrong, but my data is all in check.  I am a somewhat intelligent, fairly successful person and my weight is a flashing siren of the one way I'm dumb and cannot just get my shit together.  I don't need a magical solution but I do need to understand.  Why can't I figure this out?  What is wrong?  

My current plan is to just weight myself once a month and give up on the scale.  Keep going.  The weight eventually has to come off.",1

I was 330# and had just been diagnosed type 2. I spent a lot of time on a much smaller r/keto and learned a lot. I lost sixty pounds. Then my wife got pregnant. I gained and lost the last thirty pounds at least three times. I've lost track to be honest. I know I got as low as 255 a few years ago but by the time of my heart attack at 44 I was back to 290. I was told the yoyo dieting was partially to blame. I have had trouble starting back up again because I was afraid if I did I would gain it back and put my heart into greater distress. But I did, finally. This is the last time.

I'm down to regular obese again at 272 and wearing retail pants! I went to macy's and tried on a size 46L coat. My five year old daughter told me it made me look skinny. In other words: I just bought a new coat.

Our thing has changed a lot since 2015. It used to be people would tell you this diet would kill you. Now it is branded on sugar free ice cream at Costco.

So i promised tips from an old timer: 

Every choice is a victory.

It's not how many times you fall, it's how many times you get up.

Stay away from restaurant food, but meat in corn tortillas will do in an extremity 

Cheating is punished with a week of lost progress, but suck it up and keep going.

Low carb tortillas make a decent bun.

Microwave cheddar slices make a good taco shell.

Fasting can break a stall.

Nosalt in vitamin water zero lemonade is undetectable.

Costco sells something that looks like vitamin water zero but is gross.

Diet coke with lime is your friend.

Booze is not your friend but whiskey is at least a fond acquaintance.

If you don't want too start a conversation about your diet while eating with coworkers, just tell them you're trying to eat less carbs.

Better yet, skip breakfast and lunch on weekdays.

Even on keto, Low calorie is still the one, true path.

Every total diet collapse starts with one choice. One twinkie is too many and two is not enough.

Don't compare yourself to others on r/keto and don't be in a hurry. If your trending down for the year, rejoice in the first year you finished healthier than you started.",1

Then he proceeds to tell me where all the OTHER awesome Keto snacks are in Kroger and suggests dipping my pork rinds in queso. He then proceeds to start pointing out his colleagues who are also keto.

Keto-friendly ways to thicken up recipes?,5,jffj7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jffj7f/ketofriendly_ways_to_thicken_up_recipes/,25,1603324512.0,"I tend to improvise recipes when cooking pretty often. If something I'm making looks too thin, I usually add flour or cornstarch or another dried carb loaded product to thicken it up a bit. 

For example, I tried to make keto friendly chili last week and it ended up suuuper liquidy, so much so that I had to add noodles to soak up the extra liquid. Saved the dish, but alas it was no longer keto as planned.

Keto: a medical professional’s perspective,1668,db0l9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/db0l9r/keto_a_medical_professionals_perspective/,227,1569817123.0," Let me introduce myself: a physician assistant, in practice for 14 years. I have worked in cardiology, primary care, and pain management (not a pill mill, but treating legitimate chronic pain patients thank you very much).

I went on keto 3 months ago for weight loss, and probably vanity. Just wanted to look good in a bikini! Which I pulled off BTW, as I sit here on the  beach;) I had a basic understanding of the physiology behind this diet, but as I watched pounds melt off my body I decided to read and delve deeper into the science behind it. Into the indisputable health benefits, and the harsh contrasts between keto and the usual American diet. And the thousands of patients I have seen over the years who have suffered the devastating effects of obesity and diabetes. In cardiology, vascular disease is known to be inextricably linked to high blood sugar. In fact the link is so strong, that diabetics are treated medically as if they already have coronary disease, before they even develop it, It’s almost presumed that they will. What does that tell you? But the lie you learn in school is that FAT and cholesterol are the enemy, when SUGAR is the real culprit. It’s the same lie that physicians are taught. This is why your doctor views your diet with suspicion in spite of the fact that you are no longer obese and your A1C is now normal. This diet contradicts everything they’ve been taught. Physicians base their decisions on “evidence based medicine,” and keto isn’t in their textbooks. Not yet. Doctors (and dieticians for that matter) are not likely to admit they have been misinformed, and even less likely to think that their patients may know more than they do.

But in all fairness, not all medical professionals walk around with that sentiment. We are after all scientifically minded and know that medicine is constantly evolving, just by its very nature. My supervisor, an anesthesiologist and probably the most intelligent man I know (also the most cantankerous) became very intrigued by my weight loss, and started doing his own reading. He referred me to an online lecture by Dr Harold Lustig, a pediatric endocrinologist who for years has been lecturing on tne link between simple carbohydrates and devastating disease. ( You can access it on YouTube). And also the lies the government has fed us, i.e. the food pyramid, and the low fat/low cholesterol diet. The political pressure from tne sugar and grain ndustries to keep us in the dark. All you have to do is walk around my clinic and observe the suffering obese people endure to realize that’s complete bullshit. My doctor even says now he has a whole different view of obese patients. His whole career he has condemned and shamed them like most doctors do. He said now he realizes that they may not be solely responsible for their conditions, 

I also observed retrospectively that the joint pain from my own autoimmune disorder seemed to evaporate on this diet. This was NOT expected. I became very interested in tne link between sugar and inflammation. So is my doctor, especially since we treat joint pain all day long. It’s simply fascinating from a medical perspective. I feel like I just happened upon this wealth of information that gives me a much better understanding of the pathophysiology behind these chronic, systemic diseases. 

And all because I wanted to look cute in a bikini:) Crazy.",1

Macros: 127+ protein, >27 carbs, >1698 cal

Had a day off in my lifting routine, thought I would mess with a 36 hour fast to keep my body guessing. The hunger itself wasn’t so bad (although meal-prepping and grocery shopping on that long of a fast was kinda annoying)... 

I did feel groggy towards the pm and decided to make my first batch of Ketoade. Followed a recipe on the net that I saw here when I did a search as well.

16 ounces of water (I doubled it) 
3/4 tsp of lite salt 
And 1 tsp of magnesium citrate.

Within 30 minutes, I was flushing out like I was prepping for a colonoscopy, which I know magnesium citrate is used for.... 

I haven’t been able to find too many recipes with specific mg of magnesium that should be used, but the ones I have found say 2-4 grams. 

I bought a powder form of magnesium citrate from Sprouts by a company called stress-relax, that has 1tsp at 3.3 grams or 300 mg of magnesium citrate. 

Me being the brilliant amateur scientist of a man that I am decided to drink another ketoade an hour later as an experiment. Sure enough, within 30 minutes... 

Any advice? Wrong form of magnesium citrate? Does my body need to adapt? Could it be something to do with the 36 hour fast? 

I have been doing my best to hydrate, but want to make sure I’m getting the electrolytes too. I doubt the Niagara Falls effect is accomplishing what I am seeking to do, and I woke up feeling dehydrated before another similar trip to make a deposit to the bowel bank.",1

I wanted to reach out and share my success thus far. I am 5 weeks in, 20 lbs down and my craving has finally gone away and im no longer craving anything. I eat just to fuel my body and it feels great.

I have a problem and im doing so much research that im going nuts on this dry mouth issue. My tongue and mouth is bugging me a bunch. After reading other articles it seems like a lot of you are supplementing or eating salts and stuff to help with the elctrolyte imbalance, which I am assuming is casuing mine. I drink a ton of water but its definitely not helping. 

My only issue is that after reading all these articles im getting so much conflicting reports and stuff that I am just flat out confused. I am leaving the country in a few days and will be gone for a month. Ketoade is going to be a bit inconvenient for me and hard to do due to my nature on the go. But if needed I can make it happen.

Would someone tell me this

What do I need, magnesium citrate or glycinate? Potassium? Salt? Lite Salt? Flavor drops? Anything else? Should I take supplements, powder, 

Can someone just please without making it so complicated just tell me a easy way to help with this. If there is a fast and quick way that I can get this stuff on amazon and take 1-3 times a day I dont mind, I will spend the money.

I started the day with fasted cardio--two quick miles and a 30 minute hit where I had burned around 600 cals. I saved my calories for my dinner meal and really only had coffee/a bit of light cream, half a deviled egg all day. Zero carbs all morning (maybe 2-3 from the light cream (<1 carb/serving) in coffee.

For dinner, I (finally) eat an 18 oz ribeye for 1140 calories, 1 carb, which I couldn't even finish.  I know it was gluttonous but all I wanted was a big fatty steak, and I had saved up for it.    

For sides I got 2 orders of green beans--web site said 6 carbs/serving, I figure at least some of that has to be dietary fiber!  Worst case scenario, 12 carbs.

I drink a corona light--5 carbs and two bacardi diets--zero carbs.

This morning, I am knocked out of ketosis.  I had spent so much time online figuring out exactly what I could eat/drink and working the cals/fat!  

A five carb beer couldn't have knocked me out of ketosis?!  I feel like the restaurant added something to the steak or beans that wasn't represented on the web site nutrition, and that frustrates me.  This is the first time eating/drinking out of the house. I wanted to go out like a normal person  and socialize/have a few drinks without kicking out of keto, and I failed despite my best efforts.

Looking forward to fasting cardio to fix this tomorrow.  I seem to kick back in pretty quickly, so it's not the end of the world, but I tried so hard to stay keto and it didn't work.  /rant

Leaving Keto,2,1270za,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1270za/leaving_keto/,36,1351409448.0,"Hey guys I've been on Keto for about Three months and have been seeing some good results. In the last couple of weeks I've been questioning a couple of things and have decided to go off a strict keto diet.

My first question relates to calorific intake. If I want to continue losing weight, I need to make sure the number of calories I eat are less than my BMR or the number of calories I use. Why does its matter if I keeps carbs below 50 a day? I've been eating one lightly carbed meal a day for the last week and have found my weight loss hasn't been affected, plus I've been feeling better.

Second. I've spoken to, randomly not sought out, a couple ER doctors an when I've mentioned the diet I'm on they've told me they regularly get people coming in with complications from this diet, one of them mentioned that she's lost people as a result.

I know this is /r/keto suicide and I'm going to get down voted into oblivion (assuming anyone sees it), but I am still curious to hear what people have to say.",1

If you're eating under 20g carbs you're in ketosis."" But are we, though? If every way of testing for ketones in our body says we are not in ketosis, are we still in ketosis just because we're under 20g net carbs every day? Or if our blood shows no ketones, is that just indicative of our body using them all up? I hear so much conflicting information on this. How are we supposed to know how efficient our bodies are at processing ketones? I'm genuinely wanting to know!

I've been strict keto for 2 months - no cheats and I'm down 35 pounds and love every bit of this diet and this subreddit. This diet flat out works, but I want to keep learning. I weigh and track everything that goes into my body, and I love it. I recently got a Keto Mojo to test my blood ketones under all types of situations. Right when I wake up, after guzzling tons of Mio, while fasting, after eating a Kirkland protein bar or a Choc Zero, at differing time intervals, in the evening, etc.

Are we sure that erythritol is safe? Are we sure that Mio and sugar alcohols aren't kicking us out of ketosis? Because my blood testing seems to show that that is the case. I usually have 15 carbs per day, and I'm a big dude. It seems the longer I go wihtout ""keto-approved"" sweeteners, the higher my ketone levels are. When I have some Mio or a Choc Zero I test out as .1 or ""Lo.""

Are many of us just assuming we are in ketosis because we are under 20g carbs and losing weight, when in fact we're just losing weight because we're eating at a caloric deficit? 

Why is 20g carbs the magic number when body sizes, types and genetics are so differing? Is that based on a study? Would love to see it.

Limited Keto success? What's your PPAR-Alpha gene?,0,3re7ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/3re7ya/limited_keto_success_whats_your_pparalpha_gene/,30,1446609025.0,"I've been very disciplined with keto for about 7 weeks now, using mostly the bulletproof diet.  I know there's a ton of success out there for people on keto, and good science also demonstrating advantage vs. low-fat.

For me, I've only lost about 5 lb across 7 weeks.  The key for me is bulletproof coffee (just any butter-coffee will be fine) in the morning instead of breakfast.  From starting that, I found that I'm just not hungry, like all day until 7pm or 8pm.  Then, I get ""honest"" hunger instead of cravings.

So I skip lunch and only eat dinner, and it's not requiring any extra will-power or anything.  I eat as much as I want for dinner, which isn't outrageous and I probably eat under 1000 calories per day <<mistake, probably more like 1300calories, anyways 2 meals per day deleted vs. my norm>>.  I'm 6'2"" and 210lb, so 1000 calories should give me fast weight loss, I think.

Here's my personal ""anomolies"":

1)  Only 5 lb lost across 7 weeks (probably 35 lb overweight).
2)  Hunger destroyed by butter-coffee.
3)  I have a 2% rare mutation in PPAR-Alpha  (see http://selfhacked.com/2015/10/04/about-ppar-alpha-and-natural-ways-to-activate-it/ ).  The gene is rs1800206 L162V, and I'm CG heterozygous, where 98% of population is CC and nearly 0% are GG.  In PPAR-A knockout mice, they show an ""impaired fasting response"".  That seems to describe me.  The good news is that the gene much lowers CRP (C-Reactive-Protein) and inflammation, which also fits me.  My CRP is always ultra-low

If you did 23andme, you can check your 23andme PPAR-Alpha at this URL:
https://www.23andme.com/you/explorer/snp/?snp_name=rs1800206

Anyways, I'm hoping to connect with other keto folks who have their 23andme info and perhaps have the PPARA mutation.  Maybe we can hack together.

This Article suggests some supplements which stimulate PPARA (normally just stimulated by fasting):  http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/beast29.htm

The supplements I'm trying are:  CLA, TTA, and Sesamin.  About 10 years ago I had accidental weight-loss success by taking CLA.  I took about 6g per day, but it's confounded by the fact that during those years I was swing-dancing about 4 nights per week, regularly for years.  However, during the 3-4 months that I took CLA I remember losing about 15lb, which wasn't really happening as much during the other years of dancing, so I think it was connected.  I was completely not focused on diet or any extra exercise.

Any other PPARA CG people out there?",1

Like many of you, I watched *Forks Over Knives* and was really intrigued by the China Study. Sadly, it's apparently been debunked for a long time due to cherry-picking factoids to fit the narrative. 

Reading: http://www.catalystathletics.com/articles/downloads/proteinDebate.pdf

The journal entry goes into detail about **pre-agricultural** socieities having high animal protein diets and virtually 0 rates of cancer or heart disease. This makes me think the issue with meat in 2016 is more what we pump into it, not the meat itself.

For me a big reason to get on a PBD was to lower my risk of heart disease and cancer. Sure, all the awful hormones and junk pumped into most main-stream meat sources still makes me want to keep this diet, absolutely. I just wanted to share this important info with all of you, since you're much MUCH more open-minded than the vegan subreddit (no, I don't consider myself 'vegan').

-There Is tons of misinformation out there. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH and educate yourself! 

-Intermittent fasting 18:6 was so hard the first few weeks but I adapted and exercised while fasted. Start small and work your way up if you want!

-I eat two meals a day. No snacking! The more times you eat, the more often your insulin is signalled. The goal is to keep insulin low and not give it a reason to look for fats /carbs to be stored 

-I do exercise such as walking, gym time with light weights a few times a week for an hour. 

-Keto is a high DIETARY fat lifestyle. Eat the fatty protein cuts. Enjoy some cheese. Use your own body fat for fuel, not outside high fat food sources or weight loss will slow and plateau.

-Measure and track everything into an app. I use MyFitnessPal 

-If you feed your body “keto junk” you will feel bogged down and stall. Aim for the whole healthy foods and treat your body with respect. It will love you back.

I've been on the plant based diet for 7 years, after about 3 years I started to feel that I'm not that sharp anymore, concentration fell, thinking slowed down and I started to feel a constant pressure in my brain (frontal lobe), it's like something is pushing down on it. This feeling got worse with time but it comes and goes, last year this time it was much worse. I don't know what causes it, doctor says nothing, MRI shows nothing, I use cronometer daily since november and I try to max out everything, the only thing that is consistently low is choline 255mg (rda is 550 but that number is a guess based on 100 year old data, 50mg is deficient, so they 10x'd the rda just in case), vitamin E is at 90%, calcium is at 680mg (rda is 1000 but that too seems like an overestimate), zinc is at 115%, protein is at 1g / kg body weight, all aminos maxed when 1g is reached, omega 3:6 ratio 1:4, (4g omega3). I tried DHA algea pills, felt a bit better but don't really know if it's just placebo or not, will try again later. B12 I took 5000mcg daily in the beginning, then switched to 2000, then 1000, then back to 2000, then slowly I started taking less and less, now I take 1000 once/week. I take D3 2500iu for about a month in the winter and a bit in spring. When I first started to have this ""slow"" feeling, I began to increase B12 but I felt no change. During corona I started to workout a bit, that made me feel better but I'm really lazy and hard to stick to regular workouts, I do once a week now, sometimes twice. I quit alcohol this year, the feeling got better but still it's there. Since I started to use cronometer daily, I lost about 10kg, now I'm 23 BMI / male / 33.

The problem is that I don't remember how life was before this, mostly because I had so many problems that I wouldn't notice this now. Before I had regular diarrhea, got the cold at least 4-5 times a year, weak bones/joints (joints are still bad but got much better), stress levels were 10x of now.

I started to make a spreadsheet and monitor this feeling together with sleep, activity, mood, pain levels (my back hurts but that's a thing since high school, not as bad tho), concentration, exercise, I'm gonna monitor this for 30 days, then I'm gonna see if a high dose multivitamin helps, will use DHA too.

I'll need to make blood tests, I've been delaying it for years..I know it's bad, if you read till here, what tests you suggest? I'm gonna make B12 HoloTC, MMA tests for sure.

I'm gonna monitor the situation for a few months and if nothing changes, I'm thinking about trying liver or something similar that has a very high nutrient density. I don't want to eat meat, I just want this feeling gone.

Cronometer stats March through June, [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/159A8I1GZz\_CU5MItJW5-poq0AoiqZTPf4Hxk4xyl9xI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/159A8I1GZz_CU5MItJW5-poq0AoiqZTPf4Hxk4xyl9xI/edit?usp=sharing) ignore alcohol (it's just vanilla essence), I added notes for each vitamin/mineral for RDA.

(If there's one that doesn't please let me know!)

I've watched the FOK film, as well as The Game Changers, and I've looked for info on the Engine 2 diet as well as Dr. Gregor's Daily Dozen.

The thing is, while they're all WFPB (with the exception of Game Changers) the information is a little conflicting.\*  FOK has their list of what to eat plenty of, what to eat in moderation, and what to avoid. There's no guidance on how much to eat or what you need everyday, just that as long as you're following WFPB and ensuring you eat all the categories you'll see the benefits.  Dr. Gregor otoh has the Daily Dozen and that conflicts with FOK.  (Honestly, I'd prefer to not have to count foods everyday since that veers into dieting which is not a great place for me to be.)

So does it matter a great deal if I don't follow the Daily Dozen and instead focus on ensuring I eat a variety of foods to get all my nutrients?

(I'm much more likely to grab some fresh fruit as a snack instead of veg but Dr. Gregor says only three a day and FOK says as much as I want. Also: salt. They disagree on that too. Lol.)

\*all lifestyles say they do the exact same thing for our health, so that adds to confusion",0

I started keto 2 weeks ago and I am doing OK. But I have been struggling to lower my net carbs. I currently keep at about 30 gram net but lowering that number has been hard for me. Am I doing it wrong by trying to get vegetables in at every meal? 

Example what I ate today:
Breakfast :Adams brot with peanutbutter, cheese with turkey and liver pathe. 
Lunch : grilled chicken salad with avocado, cucumber, iceberg letuce and cream cheese as dressing. 
Dinner: an atempt at Okonomiyaki (which resulted in a 15 carb bomb)
Snacks: cashews, aged gouda, pickle, turkey and Atkins snack. 

I just got a big haul of keto friendly bread, tortillas and snacks. At least the snacks I want to use only till I get over my sugar addiction which is getting better (the craving are a whole lot better than week 1). 

But still that 20 gram mark feels impossible. Any tips are welcome. I am ""normal"" active, basic house keeping plus a couple of KM's a day. 

Trying to keep my weighloss history short but here is some background : I had a GBS in 2011 when I was weighing 170kg I went down to 104 and then gained 10kg (normal) then I got into a relationship and my now husband is not good for my health so I got back up to 130kg. 2 years ago I lost 10kg with lazy keto.

3 years ago I was 500 pounds at my absolute worst. Went through a traumatic experience when I was 17 and afterwards the weight just seemed to add on over the years. I'd always been a big guy but it got really bad. Decided to start the keto diet after looking into healthier lifestyles and fast forward two years later (with intermittent fasting and gym training) I had lost 260 pounds. I kept under 1200 calories a day and the best feeling was not constantly being hungry. The last year has been more of a maintenance but with keto cycling.

I'm at 240 now and actually weigh less than I did in high school. Have a decent amount of excess skin that skews my actual weight. Thankfully the government of Canada pays for plastic surgery in my case because it could lead to health problems in the future. Surgery is in about 8 or so months and I'm quite excited to start a completely new chapter of my life once it's done.

A big reason I feel like we use this diet, besides being healthier, is that we want to feel better about how we look, both to ourselves and to other people. I wanted to lose weight to be more attractive to the kind of women that I find attractive. I look at myself in the mirror and like the way I look, but I don't feel like any women out there share that opinion. I've never done worse in my life.

To top it off, I go out lately and see chubby guys with girls even better looking than what I could ever hope to meet. Before anyone even says it, they weren't dressed super nice, have a great car or carry themselves any different than I was.",1

Low-carb tortilla warning,0,9onr0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9onr0h/lowcarb_tortilla_warning/,18,1539726311.0,"10 weeks ago when I started keto, I replaced my sandwich habit with a low-carb tortilla habit. A couple of weeks in and I stopped making progress, and BigTexan recommended dropping the tortillas. I did, and progress started again. 

Since then I've tried Carbquik and fat-bread dough, and those have both been ok for me but not really worth the effort. I felt fine after eating them, and they had no apparent impact on my weight loss.

Last night, I was having some chicken salad for dinner and just didn't feel like eating it out of a bowl, so I put it on a couple of the tortillas that I still had. Big mistake!

I woke up this morning with awful sinus congestion: runny nose, watery eyes, pain in my cheek and between my eyes, feeling achy all over. It's like I've got a bad cold. I definitely wasn't exposed to anything that could have made me sick, so it *had* to be the tortillas.

It's inflammation from the wheat. I don't have celiac or anything like that, but I'm still sensitive. What's shocking to me isn't just how strong and fast my reaction has been, it's that  **I used to feel this way all the time, and hadn't really noticed that it stopped.** I knew my sense of smell seemed better, but I didn't realize just how inflamed I used to be all the time. 

Obviously, the remaining tortillas are in the garbage now. Never doing that again!",1

I have not been following a strict WFPB diet, well, because of all the great tasting vegan junk food out there. I will definitely follow it more closely if it means I can avoid meds for life.

Lurkers,2869,9kbus7,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9kbus7/lurkers/,251,1538384951.0,"September 3, 1999 I went to a bariatric doctor.  I weighed 360 pounds.  A wee tyke you might say.  Even then, I was worried about my weight.  Anyway, the bariatric doctor gave me some pills and some advice and I went to visit her three weeks later.  September 24, 1999 and I weighed 346 pounds.  14 pounds in three weeks!!!  Holy crap this is cool!!!       



But, I was weak.  Mentally weak.  I worked 14 to 16 hours a day, 6 days a week, and because I was mentally weak, I allowed my dumb brain to speak.  Excuses started popping into my head.  Weakness.  So for the next 16 years, I got fatter.  Telling myself that ""tomorrow"" I was going to do something.  NO PLAN, but I would do something.  Needless to say, I did nothing and I got all the way up to 593 pounds.  Now, when you weigh 600 pounds, you don't have a whole lot of ""tomorrows"" in your future.  Eating myself to death.  Hopeless.  Trapped in fat.         



Two years ago, I had a friend sit down with me and give me a ""man to man"" talk.  He laid out a PLAN.  The plan was pretty damn simple:  Don't eat carbs.  We didn't know about macros or electrolytes or any of that fun stuff.  Hell, I didn't even know about r/keto.  So, on November 14, 2016, I stopped eating carbs.  And the weight dropped off me.  Of course it was water weight, but honestly, I didn't give a crap.  THE SCALE WAS MOVING DOWN!!!  I got the keto flu in the worst way, but I didn't know it was the keto flu.  I had not even heard of keto.  I was just eating zero carbs.  The Atkins Induction Phase.       



My apartment had a little back yard, so it had a back door.  I started walking.  27 steps from the front door to the back door and 25 steps back to the front door.  You see, I had to cheat and reach out to touch the front door because I was getting so tired.  52 steps and I was DONE.  Breathing HARD.  52 little damn steps for most people.  Mount Evererst for me.       



But, I had a PLAN.  Zero carb for two weeks then up my carbs to 20 a day.  That's the second step of Atkins according to my friend.  So I started researching recipes.  While doing so, I came across r/keto.  It was cool but confusing.  Lots of success stories by people eating the way I was eating.  Cool.  Macros and electrolytes.  Confusing.  But I kept reading.  I read for a month, devouring every post.  Every response.  Nothing I read changed my plan, so I actually subscribed.  Made my first post under my old account on here the day after Christmas 2016.  My introduction post.  Told everyone that I started at 593 pounds.  Was scared that people would say bad shit to me.  I was welcomed with open arms.  I was relieved.  And happy.  I have ""friends"" who understood my PLAN. It was like walking into a bar and everyone is happy to see you.  No one here cared if I was fat.  No one gave a shit how much I weighed.  They just wanted me to get healthier.  r/keto became part of my PLAN.  I kept losing weight.  I kept walking a little bit further.  Victories like walking 100 yards to the trash can.  My world getting a little bit bigger.  The PLAN was working. 



August 19 2017, was my mom's birthday.  That morning I weighed 443 pounds.  I called my mom and wished her a happy birthday.  Told her that her birthday present from me was 150 pounds lost.  Mom cried.  Happy tears.  That day, I was freaking bulletproof.  It was hot as hell outside.  I walked 1.12 miles straight.  No stops.  1.12 miles.  Sweating like a sinner at the gates of Heaven, but I was WINNING.  Bulletproof. Unstoppable.      



According to my Samsung smart watch thingy, I walk a mile every 2300 steps.  I don't know if that is 100% accurate, but my Garmin thingy seems to say about the same thing.  Anyway, yesterday, I walked 11,900 steps.  Using my handy calculator, that means that yesterday, I walked 5.17 miles.  Long day at work.  Lots of steps.  I wasn't tired.      



This morning, I weighed 349 pounds.  Pretty excited to not see a damn 350 something.  Hoping that my 6 week stall is over.  I am no longer weak.  I am strong.     



I will turn 52 years old this October.  I am lucky.  DAMN lucky.  Damn lucky that I got so fat.  Most people my age are trying to hold on to the past.  Squeezing tighter to the past.  Trying to wring the last bit of youth from their bodies.  I am damn lucky.  I am running to my future.  Each and every day is an opportunity for new...new everything.  Excited for my future.  Cherishing my life.  Eat fewer than 20 grams of carbs.  Suck the marrow from life.   That's my PLAN.       



Lurkers.  You are worried.  Scared.  Trapped in fat.  This is your ""man to man"" talk.  Make a plan.  Suck the marrow from life.",1

Long time lurker, first time poster. I’ve struggled with my weight my whole life, always being large through high school and college, but I finally found a diet and routine that worked for me.

For the last 5 years I had been working to get under 100kgs with little results. I had lost my job, and put weight on over covid, but refused to come out of this year with nothing

I went from being a XL-XXL in shirts to a M. Pant size 38-40 to 34.

I did a diet of keto (21g carb max) and IMF, mixed in with training 5 times a week Push/Pull/Legs. I also played soccer twice a week for cardio! (I’m from Australia where it’s not too bad with covid)

I’m nowhere being satisfied yet, but I’m super happy with my progress so far !",1

Let me tell you my story. It's going to be a long one.

I have been very obese for a long time. I was hiding inside of my shell and wanted to be the guy that was never noticed. I drugged my sadness with Pizza, Soda, and Gummy Bears. Anytime I was frustrated with a work day I would leave work and eat late at night with some fast food and either doughnuts or a hostess pie. I continued to gain weight and I was so unhappy with the way I looked, I would not look at myself in the mirror.

This constant body mutilation I was causing myself led to health problems. My skin became very dry and cracked. I started to have problems with breathing and soreness throughout my body. I would have to get up at night and urinate like 3 times a night and I could never sleep well because of this. The final straw was I became impotent and I had swelling in my ankles.

I had to do something. So this past February I started going to a gym that I had a membership to for the past 6 years and I have not stepped in the doors for about 5 of those years. I thought all I needed to do was exercise and I would get healthier. So I continued to eat the same and just workout. I thought I could literally have my cake and eat it too. I thought everything was going great but I was too scared to weigh myself.

In March, I lost my father who was 70 years old. He was only 125 lbs at the time of his passing. He had dementia, he was diabetic, and had severe muscular dystrophy that affected his organs. I was devastated with his death. I continued to work out and follow the same path I was already on. A few days after my father's funeral I got the courage to weigh myself. 389.4 lbs. is what the scale told me. I was extremely unhappy with myself and I continued to drown my sorrow in food.

In April my oldest brother told me his sad news. He was only 165 lbs and he looked like an athlete. He was already diabetic for the last four years and tragically the cancer he had in his intestines came back and spread to his liver. I was devastated and shocked, I knew what that meant. His days were numbered. The most shocking part of him talking to me was that he was more concerned about me. He told me that he did not want to see me in heaven any time soon. That he wanted me to live a long life. I told him I was going to lose weight and I have been working out for the past few months. I'll be fine.

I went to work a day later and I was talking to one of my fav co-workers and I noticed that he was losing weight. He told me about this crazy diet about using fat as fuel instead of carbs. I thought this had to be the most silliest thing I ever heard. How could this work? Fat makes you fat! I know sugar would turn into fat but healthy carbs in like yogurt and cereal would not do that. I smiled and brushed off his story and advice as nonsense. A few weeks later in April, I decided to weigh myself once again. I was excited to see how much I weight I lost. So I stepped on the scale and I looked at that magical number...383?! Are you kidding me? I felt hopeless and devastated. The very next day I came to the conclusion that while I am heavy I must be healthier some way. So I went to the local grocery store and checked my blood pressure. 191 over 126. Fuck me!

I wanted to give up. I was down on myself more than ever. I thought there was nothing I could do. I need to go to the doctor and get on like every medication out there. I can't do this on my own. On my way out of the grocery store, I walked by the magazine section and I saw this one fitness mag that was highlighting the Ketogenic diet on the front cover. I was at a low point, I am going to give into this silly thing.

The next day I told my coworker I am ""in"". He decided to be my coach in a way and make sure I would give it my best shot. The first week and a half I was drained. I barely had any energy to go to the gym. I was going to tell my coworker the very next day that I give up. As a good coach he is, he got on my ass and told me that If I quit I would have not truly given it a chance. He asked me If I weighed myself. I said no, I doubt I lost any weight since I could hardly work out and I have been eating fatty foods. He said in the morning to weigh myself. So, the next morning I decided to step on the scale and prove he was wrong. When I saw the scale my jaw dropped... 367 lbs! I was now fully bought in.

\--- The rest will be super short ---

I have continued to stay on the Ketogenic Diet. (I have cheated about two days) Once I hit my goal weight I might try carb cycling with my workout days.

I have added two different fasting protocols in my lifestyle.

My relationship with food has changed and I don't crave the sugary foods anymore.

My last blood pressure taken is 127 / 83 (It's Dropping)

I am not diabetic at this time.

I owe my life to my coworker and who I now consider a great friend.

Sad Note:

My brother passed away in October. I know he is in a better place where he is not suffering anymore and I know he is very happy that I made this change.",1
MCT Oil: A Cautionary Tale.,0,2r7u48,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/2r7u48/mct_oil_a_cautionary_tale/,4,1420335253.0,"I wanted to share a recent happening with you guys in the hopes that this would help someone. I've been ketoing for about seven months now with no breaks and few cheats. I've lost 20 pounds (my BMI is now around 21.8 or something), and I generally feel pretty darned good. My plan is to KCKO forever. 

I decided to order the NOW MCT oil from Amazon recently, as I'd heard such amazing things about BPC with it. I don't have BPC every morning as a rule (I just throw in heavy cream), but I have done butter and/or plain coconut oil in the past with no ill effects. So I got the oil, and wary of the bowel explosion warnings I'd heard from others on this sub, I used a teaspoon in my coffee for two days. 

Here's the unexpected side effect that I experienced: anxiety. Like, waking-up-in-the-night, chest-pounding, freakout anxiety. I have no mental issues that I'm aware of, so this was out of the freaking blue, and I was terrified that I'd somehow developed an anxiety disorder. I didn't immediately connect it to the MCT, so I thought maybe I was having an electrolyte imbalance issue (which I figured was strange, as I'm good about supplementation with lite salt, magnesium, and broth, and I drink tons of water). But in any case, I started feeling better on the evening of the day I didn't take the oil and am feeling back to normal now, a few days later. 

Of course I'm not *positive* it was the MCT that caused the anxiety, but the fact that I've never had it before (and it went away right when I stopped the oil), it seems likely as the cause. I'm sure this is an unusual side effect, but I wanted to let everyone know in case it can help someone who's searching this sub. For most people, MCT seems to help with all kinds of issues, but apparently I can't take it. :(",1

A couple months ago, we all got to talking and decided that we all needed to make some lifestyle changes and lose some weight because my wedding is next year, and they wanted to look good for it. They were both also at risk for HBP and some other health conditions.

My mom has lost about 10 pounds but haven’t really seen much of a difference (damn you men and your genes to lose weight! 😂 And it actually be noticeable!).

But he said that he hadn’t really noticed how much he’d lost until he saw these pictures side by side! I can totally see it in his face, gut, and even his thighs! All his clothes are baggy on him now, and he loves it!

Macros- Calories- OMAD- Workout Suggestions,6,jffjo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jffjo7/macros_calories_omad_workout_suggestions/,4,1603324553.0,"Hi Everyone!

I am finally mentally ready to start Keto again (This time I'm not giving up) I started 9 days ago and have already lost 10 pounds which I know is mostly if not all water weight. 

26F/ SW:285 CW:275 lightly active

I'm looking for a little advice.. 

I have used the Keto calulator to calculate my macros and I feel like its asking me to eat to many calories/ more than I personally want to consume. I have experimented with OMAD and eat from 5:30-6:30pm window- I have never felt better- so clear and have a lot of energy during the day. I do drink one coffee in the morning and a lot of water to help me keep full during the rest of the day. I really like OMAD and would like to stick to it at least Monday-Friday. I have a one year old son at home and would like to eat smaller meals as a family on the weekend during his meal times. I can average about 1000 calories during this time and this makes me feel very full and satisfied. I am wondering what my Macros/ Calorie intake should be during this time?  or any advice/feedback? Please go easy on me as I am new to this. 

I am also looking for suggestions for what I should be doing as far as workouts! 

My reason for wanting to lose the weight is to be at a weight I'm comfortable with to start trying for baby number 2, to set a good example for my children, and to be more confident and happy with myself. 

Thank you so much!",1

Well worth it I think, I hope some of you find the information and experiences useful!*

---

So this whole process has been kind of unreal for me. I never thought that I would be able to lose this much weight, especially losing it as fast as I have. Over 70lbs in 6 months of Keto and 4+ months of intermittent fasting. 

I got my new driver’s license at the beginning of November and I kind of stared at it in disbelief. I was fat, like really fat. I decided that I had to do something, something had to give before my health decided to give. 

I started researching online for ways to lose weight, I knew that exercise alone wasn’t going to get me where I wanted to be. In my research I stumbled upon Keto, this magical diet where you were able to eat bacon every day and lose weight. I thought, alright that sounds easy enough, I could manage that. 

I decided to start on my 26th birthday. I went from eating gas station/fast food  everyday to going grocery shopping for the first time in the last 5 years and starting to cook for myself. 

I knew starting out that I didn’t want to be overly strict. I knew that if I tried to meticulously count every calorie, I was going to have a hard time sticking with it and that I would probably give up, so I started reading labels and trying to get as close to my recommended macros as possible. 

I read this subreddit every day for tips, how to start and just got amazed every single day by someone losing an incredible amount of weight and turning their life around by eating this way. 

By the end of November I decided I needed to get a scale to actually figure out my weight. My first weigh in, two weeks after being with Keto, 237lbs. Taking into account water weight I lost in the first week or two, I was definitely over 240lbs starting out.  

I started feeling better and better. And then I realized carbs weren’t necessary at all. For some reason, I had thought that I needed 20 net carbs a day. Once I found that out, I cut out all of the unnecessary carbs out of my diet. I also got told early on that I needed to restock my body by carbing up once a week and then I found out, that was absolutely unnecessary. And the more and more I learned, the better I felt so I knew I was heading in the right direction. 

In the beginning of 2018, I learned about fasting.   I wanted to be able to have really big meals and I jumped straight into eating one meal a day. Doing that meant I didn’t have to worry about packing a lunch and or preparing and cleaning my kitchen twice or three times a day. The start was pretty tough, but by the end of eating one meal a day for that first week, it felt natural so I stuck with it. 

At this point, I have continued to eat one meal a day since jumping into fasting and I have continued to refine this way of eating intuitively. I haven’t tracked a single calorie in an app or notebook since I’ve started. It works for me, but it doesn’t work for everyone. 

I’m at a point now where I don’t really care about weight as a number. I know that I can keep up eating the way I do, continue to fast daily and I’ll continue to feel good. As long as I continue to feel good, I’ll be comfortable in my own skin. Loose skin or the vanity weight that remains is going to eventually come off. 

I would definitely not be this well off without having found this community. It continues to inspire me every day. And I love being able to try and help some of you so you don’t make some of the mistakes I made when I started. So thank you all, KCKO.

###**FAQ:**

>	***What is Lazy Keto?***

Lazy Keto can take on many definitions, here is how I define it: I take a mental note of macros. I consciously make an effort to limit my net carbs as low as possible while still indulging in vegetables. I read labels meticulously and make educated judgments of how much I should eat. I try to keep as close to what my macros should probably be while mostly eating to satiation. This has been working really well for me, but does not work for everyone. To be honest, fasting has probably granted me a ton of wiggle room and has allowed me to reach my goal while not measuring macros.

>	***How often do you fast?***

I've maintained eating at the most, one meal a day since the beginning of 2018. Sometimes I'll even go for two or three day fasts. I haven't done anything beyond a three day fast. I haven't found a need to do longer than that.(*I like food too much*) 

>	***Do you work out?***

Yes, but only recently here in the last month. Starting out with Keto, I just wanted to focus on losing the weight, I didn’t want to be fat anymore. So here in the last month I decided to just do some basic workouts to get some of my strength back. I’ll do sets of planks, squats, leg lifts, 25lb dumbbell lifts and a lot of stretching. And then here in the last few weeks, I’ve gotten back to my all time favorite activity, bicycling. I realized that I really missed physical activity, the way I feel after exercise. 

>	***What do you eat?***

So this varies a little bit, but not a whole lot. I’m a huge advocate for keeping it simple. It keeps the grocery bills lighter and overall limits the time I have to spend in the kitchen. I work 12+ hours a day for most of the year, so the less time I have to spend preparing, the more time I can spend enjoying life. Here are the main staples to my way of eating:

-	Eggs
-	Bacon
-	Sausage
-	Chicken legs
-	Steak 
-	Fish (mostly Tilapia/Salmon)
-	Cheese 
-	Broccoli
-	Cauliflower
-	Asparagus
-	Avocado 
-	Pork Rinds
-	Coconut Oil/Avocado Oil/Butter/Mayo
-	Creole Seasoning
-	Black Coffee, Water, La Croix

Occasionally, I change it up a little bit, add something new, but the list above is what my diet mostly revolves around.

>	***Do you drink any alcohol?***

I've had a couple of shots of whiskey and few beers since starting. In the last couple of months, I've completely cut out alcohol.

>	***Do you eat out at all?***

Almost never. I tend to skip fast food all together. On occasion I will indulge in Buffalo Wild Wings: Traditional/Dry Rub.

>	***Have you ever had a cheat day?***

Yes, back when I first started out I was led to believe that you needed to refuel your body with carbs, once a week for health. And then I figured out that whole idea was basically a waste of my time by resetting all of my progress.   So I haven’t had a cheat day since early December. 

>	***Do you supplement?***

Yes. I take a daily multivitamin, a vitamin D3 and a couple Omega-3 pills every day.

Also, electrolytes are super important with Keto. I would have quit a long time ago if I had not found a way to successfully manage my electrolytes. It’s really the only thing that I meticulously track with Keto. That being said, I know you’re going to ask, what is it that I do to keep track of my electrolytes? And the answer to that is that I make my own recipe of *Ketoade*:

-	2 TSP of Salt - Straight from your local grocery store.
-	¼ TSP of Potassium Citrate - I buy this in bulk from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/BulkSupplements-Potassium-Citrate-Powder-Kilogram/dp/B00ENSA93S/ref=pd_bxgy_121_img_3?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00ENSA93S&pd_rd_r=3T3W5XXZBP7AFXFEW45Y&pd_rd_w=orLRx&pd_rd_wg=8BuAZ&refRID=3T3W5XXZBP7AFXFEW45Y&th=1) 
-	⅛ TSP of Magnesium Citrate - I buy this in bulk from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/BulkSupplements-Magnesium-Citrate-Powder-Kilogram/dp/B00GW5NX8I/ref=pd_bxgy_121_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00GW5NX8I&pd_rd_r=0A5SVPXSAX5641T6E80C&pd_rd_w=QZt6J&pd_rd_wg=wgGUp&refRID=0A5SVPXSAX5641T6E80C&th=1).
-	For flavor, I add a splash of Apple Cider Vinegar. You could also add Mio or a Lemon/Lime juice if you were so inclined.

All of that gets mixed into a 40oz bottle of water and sipped on throughout the day along with all of the other drinks I consume on a daily basis. I cannot stress enough to **sip** on this throughout the day, if you try to chug, you will have a bad time.

>	***Do you have any loose skin?***

I have a little bit of loose skin, mostly noticeable when I put myself in a position that my belly can hang. I've tried longer fasts and working out, I think time is going to be the only thing that will dictate whether it eventually goes away. I used to be worried over the thought of loose skin, but when it comes down to it, I'd rather have loose skin than to go back to being obese.

>	***How often do you weigh yourself?***

I usually do a weigh in once a week. Occasionally I'll do it more often to get a general idea of my trend. The most important thing is not obsess over it.

>	***Life after Keto?***

Planning on sticking with this way of eating for life. I've been maintaining 165-170 for about the last month or so. Between adding a bit more muscle and losing a bit of belly fat, I don't have much to lose. For the first time in years, I'm happy with my weight. I love eating this way, couldn't imagine going back to feeling bloated with mood swings!

###**Things I’ve Learned Along the Way:**

-	***Don't Talk About Keto:*** Yes, you may want to sing the good song of Keto to anyone within earshot, but there is still a lot of misconception around fat making you fat. Keep it to yourself until someone actually wants to know exactly how it is you have lost all your weight. For the most part, I tell people I lost my weight from cutting out sugar and processed carbohydrates. Save yourself the grief of being lectured that carbohydrates are essential and fat is bad, keep it to yourself!
-	***Keep it Simple:*** I stated this above, but I think it needs reiterating. It’s so easy to get lost in how complex you can make recipes. In my own experience and especially for those of you just starting out, the more complex you make this, the more unsustainable this is going to be for you. If you keep it simple, it’s going to be relatively easy to maintain this way of eating by cooking for yourself (if you are an unexperienced cook like myself) or find yourself on the go a lot (also much like myself)
-	***Keep on top of your electrolytes:*** Use my recipe up above or make sure you’re getting the recommended daily minimums through food consumption. If you’re feeling like crap while doing Keto, more than likely you aren’t getting enough electrolytes.
-	***Trust the process:*** Stalls happen, weight loss is erratic and non-linear. Keep at it, trust the process and wait for the whoosh. Body recomposition is a thing. Not seeing that number going down on the scale does not mean you aren’t making any progress. If you are experiencing a stall (over a month with absolutely no change in weight): Make sure you have recalculated your macros recently and or start tracking meticulously with a food scale if you aren’t.
-	***If you mess up:*** Mistakes happen. The good news is that you probably won’t [explode](https://imgur.com/5N4uhZt) from eating too many carbs one day, don't let one mistake derail your entire experience. I've made a few mistakes that I listed above. Figure out what you did wrong, own up to it, make a mental note and correct it. All it takes is 24 hours and under 20 net carbs to get back on the right track.

---

###**A Word on Macros:**

-	This is the [calculator](https://calculo.io/keto-calculator) I use to calculate what I should be eating even though I do not meticulously track myself.
-	***Protein***. Your protein macro is a goal that you want to meet or exceed to maintain/build muscle mass. A lot of confusion floats around eating excess protein and that excess protein in the diet gets turned into glucose through a process called gluconeogenisis. Yes, some protein does get turned into glucose (gluconeogenisis), but this is a natural, demand driven process. Your brain needs glucose to run properly as it can’t run off of Ketone bodies. When the body does not have a readily available supply of glucose for the brain, the liver will create a set amount of glucose to keep the brain healthy. One of the main reasons I believe that too much protein can be bad for you is due to the fact that protein does create a small insulin response when it is digested. Too much insulin production leads to insulin resistance which is a leading cause of obesity and then type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases/inflammation. That being said, the insulin response created from consuming protein is very minimal when compared to the insulin response from consuming carbohydrates.
-	***Fat***. Your fat macro is supposed to be an upper limit, the source of most of your calories, and becomes increasingly more important to meet as you get closer the weight you want to maintain. If you’re having issues with hunger especially in the first month or so of starting Keto, don’t be afraid to overeat with this macro in particular. Keeping yourself full means you are less likely to give up and fall back into old habits. However, if you are on the opposite side of the spectrum, you can absolutely eat less fat and widen your deficit. Best way to think of fat is as a lever to control your weight lose/maintain/gain. 
-	***Carbohydrates***. Your carbohydrate macro should be a strict limit. Stick to 20 or less net carbs in a 24 hour period and you are in like Flynn. To note, there are zero essential carbohydrates and it is not necessary to consume 20 net carbs a day. Use that 20 to get some veggies in your diet, get the micronutrients that can be consumed naturally from natural carbohydrates. If you are unaware and you think that you can’t fit something into that 20 net carbs a day, make sure that you are actually calculating net carbs ( Total Carbs - Fiber - Sugar Alcohols = Net Carbs).  
-	If you need help looking up nutritional information for any particular food, a simple google search will usually get you what you need (just be wary of MyFitnessPal posts as they are user submitted and can often be incorrect) or type in your inquiry to the [USDA Nutritional Database](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list)

I've grown up big. I've been a fat guy my whole life. I've dealt with it, been depressed about it, and cried about it. I'm a 29 year old man, and I've cried because of being fat. I've tried to lose weight many times in the past, unsuccessfully. I went to the hospital last May, and I wasn't really weighing myself because I knew the grim reality. Mentally, I had accepted I was huge and I'd probably be dead before I reached 60 as my family's genes are known for heart issues. The nurse told me I had **weighed 350 lbs**. *Yikes.* As the summer went on, I realized how lonely I was. I saw someone I looked up to lose some weight and it really inspired me to TRY to lose weight (shouts out to Rocco from Mega64 for that one). I tried to get out more but I just was never happy. And then I started to exercise a little and saw no change. Then WoW Classic came out and I wasn't leaving my room and eating Zebra Cakes all day. I was watching a streamer who began to talk about their experience with weight loss and they truly motivated me to get to work and change my damn life around (shouts out to GreekGodX). 

So on Sept 2nd, 2019, I got rid of the Zebra Cakes. I dumped out the carb-filled drinks. I began anew. I had some bumps in the road to start, and realized I was eating WAY more strict than I had to, counting TOTAL CARBS instead of net carbs. But the ball was rolling. I learned a lot and lost quite a bit in a small amount of time. My coworkers were constantly telling me I had looked great. But I wasn't seeing it myself. I don't know what it is about the human brain, but I can't see it when I look in a mirror. It's like a phantom that haunts me, I can't unsee myself as huge. I was wearing 4XL shirts and now I'm wearing a XL shirt. From size 52 waist jeans to 40 waist jeans. But I can't see it still. I have a jawline now. But unless I see a photo side by side, it's almost like it doesn't matter. It's the worst feeling. But I know I'm succeeding. **I now weigh 250 lbs.** I have been stagnant for about four weeks total now, despite meeting my macros. But, that comes with the territory. I'm still very pleased with my progress. I can RUN again. I go for jogs sometimes now!

Progress Photos:

On the left, was May 2019 at 350 lbs. On the right, was March 2020 at around 270 lbs. I currently don't have a better one at 250 lbs, but this was one of the first photos where I truly saw change, so I'm sticking with it here. Coronaszn has made it so I haven't really had much interaction with others, so no opportunities to take a photo! 

For anyone thinking about starting keto, do it. I loved pizza more than anything, but fat head dough and chicken crust pizza have been saviors. There are so many delicious things (and I don't even mean just vegetables, despite loving asparagus now) you can have! 250 lbs, or 100 pounds lost, in 12 months was my original goal but here I am 3 months ahead of schedule. Now I'm aiming for 200 lbs by January. I hope to make it! 

I've had two really eye opening, revealing moments that got me emotional: 

1. I take an annual photo at a gaming convention with my friends, and with a group I follow online. These were my first ""comparison"" photos to last year. It wasn't until I saw these photos side by side with last year's photos that I could see a drastic change. I told my friends how incredible it felt to me, but I don't know that it was understood. People may think I'm exaggerating when I say I can't see the difference, but when I saw the photo...I had such joy I cried in the bathroom for a bit. I felt so accomplished finally...

2. I've been wearing 4XL shirts forever. They've gotten really loose on me so I started wearing my 3XL shirts from back in the day...and then I bought a single 2XL shirt and it fit pretty well. That felt nice! And then, there was this T-Shirt I REALLY wanted, but was only available in an XL size. I took a chance, thinking, at least maybe in 6 more months it would fit. It arrived, and damn it, it fit well. It's a little SNUG but it FITS. I haven't worn an XL ANYTHING since I was in 6th grade. This felt AMAZING. But now it's time to start replacing my wardrobe and make my pockets hurt. 

I hope if nothing else, perhaps someone can get some inspiration or motivation from this. Keto will help. And I feel like it's saved my life.",1
Maybe someone can relate?,0,j7ybgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/j7ybgc/maybe_someone_can_relate/,12,1602276538.0,"So I've done the keto diet before with huge success. It was about three years ago, I stayed on it for six months with my dad, and together we each lost 50-60 lbs. We didn't exercise or anything. Just watched our macros.  


I gained a bit back, yo-yo dieted for a few years. Last year I got into running (not on keto) and wound up losing a ton of weight without watching my diet (I was running around 25-35 miles a week). I wound up going about 15 lbs lower than my lowest on keto years back.  


So, I'm on day 10 of keto. I'm working out twice a day; typically a long walk or yoga in the morning, and then a run of 4-5 miles in the evenings. I'm aware of what I should be looking for because of this sub from the first time I did keto: ghost carbs, calories in the oils/butter I cook in, etc. I log EVERY gram and calorie I take in, as well as the exercise. I'm at a 20% calorie deficit. Not only am I eating better than I was the first time I did keto, but I'm working my butt off from an exercise standpoint.  


Day 10, I have lost 0 lbs. Normally, I would expect to be down at least 5 lbs of water weight at. this point (35M, 215lb SW). But nothing.   


Question: Is it me holding onto water for muscle recovery? Is it just a wait for the whoosh? The only difference between this time and my other dances with keto is that I'm burning around 600-800 calories a day with exercise. You'd think the lbs would come off faster, right?

Anyway, a look at McDonalds web site gave this info: ""Every one of our burgers is made with 100% pure beef and cooked and prepared with salt, pepper and nothing else—no fillers, no additives, no preservatives. We use the trimmings of cuts like the chuck, round and sirloin for our burgers, which are ground and formed into our hamburger patties.""

To keep a long story short- I’ve been fat and depressed for almost my entire life (I’m 25). 2 years ago I had a pretty severe breakdown that almost cost me my job and did cost me my partner at the time (no huge loss in hindsight). Ever since then I felt like I was living life in some sort of haze and I spent the last year just kind of accepting that, this was who I was now. Turns out it’s DID of some kind, who knew. 

I’ve been doing Keto for one month. I cannot stress how much better I feel. I don’t think about dying all the time or wishing I was somebody else. I feel like a new person or even better- an old person, the one I felt like before. My head is clear, I can feel emotions again and I am so happy. I’ve also lost 20lbs which is obviously a rad bonus. 

I haven’t once been tempted to cheat, every time I look at something I know I shouldn’t eat, I just remember how bad I felt before and how good I feel now. It’s a super reliable motivator! 

I’m not saying that this will work for everybody, but I feel like my life has been turned around in literally a month. Here’s to the future!",1

I've only been on 7 days but I feel like I have more energy. I had on and off headaches for like 2 days but they stopped. I'm waking up earlier in the morning, like 7am with no alarm and I actually look forward to getting out of bed. Before I started keto, I would sleep late til like 1pm with the ""whats the point of getting out of bed"" Mentality. I haven't been sucking back coffees or taking hydroxycut and I've been smoking less cigarettes. I have 1 large coffee a day now, and it's homemade coffee. I don't feel the need to buy one at a drive thru. And before I have my coffee I can actually do a few things around the house now like wash the dishes in the sink, sweep the floor, scoop the litter box, make my breakfast etc. Like I had a serious caffeine addiction. Taking hydroxycut as soon as I woke up was the only way I could function through the day and feel somewhat normal. It wasn't even about trying to lose weight anymore. I needed it to function. I was smoking a pack of cigarettes a day too and I've cut down to like 10 cigarettes with no effort. My skin has a glow to it. I've mostly been eating spinach, eggs, chicken, zucchini, olive oil, and avocados. I tried to avoid dairy because in the past I felt like it made my face puffy but I binged on cheese a little bit the last 2 days (mozzarella, cream cheese and shredded cheddar) and to my surprise it hasn't made me puff out. I'm not counting calories, but I haven't had any bread, pasta, potatoes, rice, beans etc. And I plan to avoid starchy vegetables all together. I feel slimmer already. It could just be water weight but I'll take it because I already feel a lot better and I'm excited to see how much better this can get.

Month 2 plant-based: sharing some thoughts,110,i0rrkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/i0rrkl/month_2_plantbased_sharing_some_thoughts/,40,1596163934.0,"Hi guys,

So this is my second month (tomorrow) of eating plant-based and I just wanted to share some thoughts with you guys. Overall I am so happy and pleased with my choice and this is the best decision I have ever made for myself. I hope this post can inspire other people lurking on this subreddit and also shed light on some other issues and how to address them :)

* My poops have been phenomenal. Seriously. We are talking 3-4 times a day phenomenal. What the heck?

* I have PCOS and for the first time ever, my period came at 26 days and my cramps have been minimal. I am feeling like on a cloud.

* I experience much less reactive hypoglycemia (used to need multiple naps a day).

* I have discovered so many new delicious recipes and ways to enjoy fruits and veggies. I feel healthier and happier.

* Not sure if related, but I have definitely experienced spiritual changes when it comes to my view of the world, other people, and animals. It has made me much kinder and aware of my role in either reducing or promoting suffering and I feel less self-involved.

* I have met delightful and like-minded people who made me feel welcome and a part of the community!!!!

* I feel better and happier and plan to never go back to eating animals or animal products again :)

Some lesser good things and what I did to address them:

* I had a period of losing my hair, which seems to have gotten better now. I think it might have been the shock of such a drastic change (was an omnivore prior to going plant-based).

* b12 induced acne (was taking like 1,000mg daily). Ahhhhhg!!! Especially around the chin area. I focus on consuming fortified foods now such as almond milk with added b12 or the occasional mock meats and shakes. 

* reading labels can be hard and I messed up once buying mock meat with egg white powder. It was super deceptive marketing and I am now being extra careful.

* my mom is taking my choice as a personal confrontation and it is hard to make her accept that and my need for boundaries and not consuming what she cooks. I hope we can work on that and I can show her how it’s helping me and the planet :)


That’s all I had in mind folks!!!! Thanks for reading and I hope this helps other people beginning their journey. :)",0
Moral dilemma to cook more plant-based but want to help people eat less animal products,2,ene955,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/ene955/moral_dilemma_to_cook_more_plantbased_but_want_to/,4,1578809797.0,"I know this title is strange for this subreddit, but just be respectful if you have any input. I'm sure everything I'll say will provoke some responses. TL;DR at the bottom.

I'm into plant based eatery 100%. I'm very much interested in making cooking a career going to school, learning things online, and resources on the side as well. My Mom and I had a long conversation about my desire to help others eat heathier and to cook for them. She thought it'd be way more sensible to include animal products seldomly in one's meal plan considering my current placement in life living in the South where it is especially hard to get people to eat more consciously plant based because most people will associate healthy, balanced eating with the consumption and amount of particular animal foods, even though that's not really a valid stance knowing what I know now. She was trying to also explain that, of course, not everyone is gonna go vegan or fully be attuned to the morals of a vegan.

It's easier from my perspective to recognize that a lot of people are willing to ask for your service if you give them meals that limit meat and dairy while gravitating toward more plant based dishes... so basically limiting their meat and dairy intake or substituting them with plant options, emphasizing vegetable meals that taste really good. Usually the first thing people hear from vegan is ""extreme, bland, salad, etc."" but if you gave them a meal that was mostly vegetables and a bit of meat and then told them that you could still make it taste good with a plant based substitute for meat, people will be shocked because all they think about first off ""does it taste good"" rather than ""I'm eating this because it's healthy"".

People think about taste moreso than what it does for them health-wise, but I can still give them that background info on why certain foods that are healthy can be great substitutes (example... Flax egg instead of eggs for baking, scrambled tofu instead of scrambled eggs, oat milk instead of cow's milk). It's the fact that most people nowadays are curious about healthier, sustainable options and not fully committed, so Mom wants me to push for that sort of audience because she herself is curious about things but isn't fully booked with the thought of going plant based. So that's my moral dilemma... Handling meat and dairy but at the same I really am intrigued by the idea of helping those who realize they need less healthy options and are willing to try other really good things more often but not take it away fully. Granted, I'm still doing research on how to make certain faux meat dishes by hand and come close to the real thing, or if I have to I'll incorporate vegan meats from the store.

But then my SO brought up a way to compromise on the challenges of handling animal products, which is to donate most of the earnings to animal liberation. She stated that sometimes I have to sacrifice to make a difference because you're making it easier for people to make that switch. I'm saying ""everyone is welcome"" while still pushing for them to try the better options. If they DON'T want that then I'm still deep down trying to fight against the cruelty and making them think about it so they might just try the plant based option next time. It's give and take but while I'm saying there's a place for everyone I'm still doing all I can to push them over to the better and healthier version while making sure SOME good comes from the animal based meals that I might sell. 

I honestly wouldn't want to leave a demographic of people who are curious about these things while sacrificing my morals. It just helps to wake up people to better options in this way instead of saying ""you should go vegan"" and suddenly they're easily puzzled right off the bat with what to eat because they wouldn't know how to use those foods in what. I've met a lot of people who yearn to have better options and it's best not to exclude those just because I eat a plant based diet and therefore I can't help those people because I can't handle meat and dairy. I wanna help them if using meat and dairy is what I have to do... And at that point I can say that I can help anyone with any sort of diet so long as they understand that we ought to be using less and less meat and dairy until we realize they are pointless in our human diet. So that's my dilemma along with my motivation to help people shift away to better alternatives. I just want to open people's perspectives on what is right to consume and actually good to eat. What do you think? Again, please be respectful if you have any input.

TL;DR - I have a moral dilemma in order to help people transition to eat more plant based options by cooking animal products seldomly then introducing plant based substitutions into their meal plan. Any meals they include animal products with will be mostly donated to an animal liberation cause as a way to do some good leftover. What's your take on this?",0

More information on plant-based diets and diabetes,3,eiuwai,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/eiuwai/more_information_on_plantbased_diets_and_diabetes/,10,1577977274.0,"[http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/researchers-discover-process-that-may-explain-how-type-2-diabetes-develops](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/researchers-discover-process-that-may-explain-how-type-2-diabetes-develops)

>The team found that in beta cells from obese, pre-diabetic animals, a protein known as Cyclophilin D, or CypD, induced a phenomenon known as “proton leak,” and that this leak promoted insulin secretion in the absence of elevated glucose. The mechanism was dependent on fatty acids, which are normally incapable of stimulating insulin secretion in healthy animals.  
>  
>Further, obese mice who lacked the gene for CypD did not secrete excess insulin. The team confirmed the same process was taking place in isolated human pancreas cells: In the presence of fatty acids at levels that would be typical in obese humans, the cells secreted insulin in the absence of elevated glucose

But, this article doesn't fully explain any therapeutic changes or how removing fat from the diet will help improve insulin resistance.

More research on how plant based diets can reduce diabetes risk but says nothing about treatment of the disorder. It comes with the caution which others have echoed here. Food needs to be whole food, not processed ""junk"" vegan food. If I read the article correctly, it also looks like we need to eliminate a potatoes of any type. I know my glucose meter reveals the same spike for white, sweet, and yam. Alas, still no information on how type II diabetics can survive the transition to whole plant.

The last article is quite interesting. I'm trying to get a hold of the original to figure out what they mean by a ""substantial"" lunch but again reading between the lines whole plant, healthy fats such as avocado will help with type II treatment. If you look however at the timeline of eating, they are talking about 8/16 intermittent fasting with an 800 cal carb load the start and a four hundred ish calorie finish to the day.

FYI, 800 cal is roughly 200 g of carbohydrate which would so f\*\*k me over when you consider that 40 g of oatmeal and 40 g of blueberries puts me up close to 300 mg/dl.

In any case, hope these references to research help others.",0

Most cooking shows are ruined now,434,gmpy0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/gmpy0x/most_cooking_shows_are_ruined_now/,119,1589928431.0,"I've loved the art of cooking all my life, but I've only been into PBD for a few years now. Since then I find I can't relate to cooking shows anymore. I used to love them. Anthony Bourdain's was a hero of mine, and any show that looked finely into the technique of preparing food was the best entertainment I could find. Good eats was the best example of the kind of show that would get into the science of cooking. 

I just started Gordan Rasmey's Ultimate cooking class. While I still do appreciate the tips on chopping and general handling of kitchen tools, general tips on flavor just don't apply anymore. Every video (not just Gordan's) from a Chef with notoriety feels like they are saying ""to make this thing not taste horrible you should do this unhealthy thing to it."" The (supposed) advice that every dish needs meat or obscene amounts of oil for flavor is now equivalent to those wannabe cooks who just put bacon on everything. 

Restaurants of basically an extension of this. When I didn't feel like cooking myself an ideal date was to go get someone else's food and explore their interpretation of flavor. Now that I've really adapted to this lifestyle it seems professional chefs are all misguided. Proper food preparation should be first about putting healthy sustenance in your body, and the art of making those things tasty is the cherry on top. When most restaurants can't even give me a bowl of cooked greens without making it unhealthy, it feels like the entire profession has forgotten the face of their fathers. 

This is mainly to vent to a space I know others relate, but if anyone has advice or sources for quality cooking entertainment I'd love to know.

Update: Maybe not all shows are ruined after all. Thanks to you wonderful people I've discovered a treasure trove of content on the internet. Just look at these recommendations below! While many of these vegan YouTubers use oil, I can easily see removing that one ingredient from the recipe and the food still being great!",0

Hi everyone! So I am 6 months into keto, doing great (I've lost around 60 pounds!)

Here's the story, please read because this isn't your 1st guess of a HYPO issue. When I started keto back in April, I supplemented everything:K, Mg, Na, Ca, MVT.  I didn't feel well, muscle cramps at night, tired feeling muscles, etc so I stopped taking any supplements. I think I was going over. I've felt great for months but because of muscle aches all over my body I started up again on Monday: I've been taking 1280mg of K and 1000mg of Mg the last 3 days.  Last night I was woken quite few times with leg cramps. I haven't had cramps since I first started keto and oversupplemented. Is it high K?? High Mg would have the opposite affect right? I'm going to go down to 300mg K and 250mg Mg per day or every other but I'd love to know which is the culprit. Thank you!!!",1

My 14 Points of Keto.,2589,abr52u,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/abr52u/my_14_points_of_keto/,498,1546442754.0,"I've been on this sub for an entire year, and eating keto for 15 months; this being my first New Year as an experienced ketoer, I feel (probably wrongly) inclined to offer the small bits of wisdom I've accumulated with the help of this sub...at 2:00 in the morning, so it's guaranteed to be buried in other posts within a few hours (but I don't care because I had fun typing it all out). These are all the things I either wished someone had told me about when I started, or things people here *did* tell me that changed the way I looked at/did things because I didn't pay enough attention to the FAQ. Most of this stuff is in the FAQ, some of it isn't. They're in no particular order.


1. *Electrolytes are REALLY important*, even if you think they aren't. You need like 5000mg sodium, bro (among others).  Powerade Zero won't do a damn thing unless you pour Lite Salt in it, which you should. 


2. *Take measurements.* I never did and I wish I had. Take before pictures too! I *did* take those and they really helped for those days I felt like I wasn't making any real progress. I was.  You might not lose weight at some points in your keto journey, but you're probably losing inches!


3. *A ""stall"" is 5-6 weeks with no weight loss.* There were a few times I went 3-4 weeks without seeing the scale move, and then boom... I'd wake up one morning 4lbs lighter. Don't freak out if the scale stops moving if it hasn't been 5-6 weeks yet. 


4. *Recalculate your macros OFTEN.* I did it every ten pounds. You should not be eating the same calories weighing 150 that you ate at 200. Makes sense, right? Took me a bit to figure this one out, though! 


5. *Hormones go a little nuts.* For me as a woman, anyway. Ladies, I had a 54-day period when I started keto. STRAIGHT DAYS. I pushed through it and it eventually leveled out! My cycle is better now than it's ever been in my life, actually. r/xxketo helped me through that HORRIBLE ordeal! Check them out, those women kick serious ass. 


6. *Hair loss happens to some, not all.* My hair didn't start thinning until I was 7 months in and I'd lost 65lbs. It's not keto that causes it, though... it's weight loss in general. After upping my protein and taking collagen and biotin supplements (which I can't confirm for sure were effective, that's just what I tried), I'm starting to see new growth coming back in 8 months after the thinning started.  Still though, losing all the weight was WELL worth it.


7. *Don't waste your money on urine strips.* Unless you're a type 1 diabetic, of course. Already bought some? Find a type 1 diabetic and regift them! That's not weird, right? 


8. Contrary to popular belief, *you don't have to do intermittent fasting with keto.* If you can eat for 12 straight hours and stay within your macros, then awesome! I accidentally started IF because I wasn't hungry in the mornings anymore and I've since progressed to OMAD...but if you don't want to, you don't have to. I love it, others don't. You do you. 


9. *I eat the same thing every. Single. Day.* I've seen people asking if this is bad. It's not. It's fucking awesome, simple, and I love it. 


10. *Protein is a goal, fat is a limit.* I was pouring coconut oil into my coffee and gagging on it because I thought I had to hit my fat macro the first week I did keto. Don't force feed yourself fat because of that number! In fact, if you're doing this for weight loss, you may want to rethink things like fat bombs after the first few weeks. 


11. *Buying new clothes is expensive* and incredibly rewarding. Mostly expensive, though. Don't pay a lot for your in-between-sizes wardrobe. Check out Goodwill or Target's hardcore clearance rack, and don't get attached to anything you buy at this point!


12. *People are going to say stupid things to you* when they notice your weight loss. Sure, some will be genuinely happy for you and they'll tell you so, but others will do the backhanded compliment, like ""you're looking SO MUCH BETTER at this weight.""  I had a coworker pull me to the side to ask me if I was terminally ill. Be prepared to deal with this really weird series of reactions to your hard work: I certainly wasn't!


13. *There is always a reason to cheat,* as the legendary u/DClawDude says, and he's right. People at work at home, at social outings, will ALL push food on you. They'll look at you weird for not taking a breadstick at Olive Garden or for drinking water instead of craft beer like you used to. Don't let peer pressure be the reason you keep those pounds on. Those people don't have to live with your weight, *you do.* The longer you stick with this way of eating, the easier it gets to tell people no when they pass you a piece of cake. 


14. *This sub is the reason I was successful.* I know in the end, it was *my* decision to stick with it, work hard to stay within my macros, not cheat a single time, blah blah blah. But really, without the daily (hourly, even!) support of this sub, I really wouldn't have reached my goal so quickly and efficiently. I created this Reddit account, my first and only one, specifically for r/keto, and I am so very happy I did. They are helpful, knowledgeable, wise, and eager to fix your issues (as long as you read the FAQ first...""did you turn it on and off again?*) if you give them a chance. Listen to them, whether they're gentle and way too nice or harsh and straightforward: they mean well and they can help you succeed if you allow them to. 


tl;dr - u/ReverseLazarus started typing some tips for a newbie that PMed her a question and decided to elaborate on all of them and post them to r/keto. Then she realized there were 14 of them, squealed with joy (on the inside, of course) and decided to give this long-ass post a history-nerd title that really exposes the kind of person she is.

<TLDR> Started keto Jan 1 at 240 lbs | 5'9"" and 49 years old. Goal was to be fit by my 50th birthday - today) Have lost 60 pounds - 5 pounds shy of my goal weigh of 175)

[Before and After Pictures](https://imgur.com/XQzMTpR)

Long version below:

By the end of 2018 it was clear that my weight had gotten out of control as I hit a personal best (#sarcasm) when i topped out at about 242 pounds. For a guy who was 49 and just barely 5'9"" that was a ton too much weight to carry around. I've never been one to diet and my eating habits didn't seem terrible to me at the time.  I wasn't into pop/soda or lots of sweet foods etc. but there I was at 242 pounds. I remember hitting 200 for the first time many years ago. That was tough but I carried on, then 220, then 230 then 240+. Where was this going to end? Dead by 60 and 300 pounds?

I also found myself avoiding things I once loved to do because I didn't think I could physically handle it (e.g. Skiing, hiking, hockey, swimming (requires removal of shirt .. ewwww) etc.)

A friend of mine that I hadn't seen for a couple of months had lost a ton of weight and quickly. Lucky for me he didn't follow the first rule of keto and told me all about it. We had a New Years party coming up and we decided to make it a keto themed party with everyone bringing a keto dish or two. I decided that night, Dec 31st, 2018 that I would take the plunge and I started Jan 1, 2019.

I was turning 50 this year and I wanted to be fit and fifty rather than fat and fifty. I just needed to change that ""A"" into an ""I"". So I set a goal to get to ONEderland by my birthday, Today Aug 7th. Well that goal got crushed by mid-March just in time for my daughters 18th birthday so I set a new goal - 175 by today. I came close - I hit a record low of 177.5 last week and am sitting at 180 as of this morning. 60 pounds gone in 7 months. I've set a new goal of 165 by November 20th (my 20th anniversary). I haven't been under 185 since my 20's - that is a damn long time.

The road to 180 has been pretty easy. It can be hard at times but as I have seen posted here many times (thanks u/DClawdude) you need to choose your hard. Being fat is hard, losing weight is hard. Choose your ""hard"".

I've had many non-scale victories along the way. Last week I bought (and wore) my first 30 waist pant (down from a snug 40 inch waist). Carpal tunnel in both wrists - gone. Heartburn at least weekly - gone. Sweating like a beast from the slightest movement - gone. Snoring like a beast - gone. Wifey beating me in my sleep because of the snoring - gone. Blood test scores - perfect across the board (Dr. is onboard with keto) Borrowing clothes from my athletic, 16 year old son - fun! Confidence - way up. General all round wellness and happiness all up.

It hasn't been a perfect ride. I've been pretty strict but will lapse into lazy keto mode and that slows things down. When that happens I switch back to measuring and tracking and things start moving again. I do a combination of Intermittent Fasting, a couple of longer fasts of 2 and 4 days, OMAD weeks and other weeks of 2 or 3 meals a day. Seems to keep my body guessing. My big miss is on exercise. I haven't done much exercise so starting to lift heavy things will be phase two. I just need to summon the discipline and get at it.

Finally a big shout-out to the contributors on this community. You are truly a wonderful group.

What started off as a quick way to lose weight before my ski trip in February turned into one of the best decisions of my life. I feel like I have so much more energy and I'm not out of breath after performing menial tasks like walking up stairs or even tying my shoes.  Louis C. K. joke was becoming all too real whenever he said bending over was like trying to fold a bowling ball in half. So here I am 12 months later still going strong. With my scale reading 199.2 this morning I have officially reached my initial goal. I think now, however I still can afford to lose a few more pounds of fat before I decide to pack on some muscle. In the beginning I never thought this goal of mine was achievable but the more time I spent on the countless keto threads, the more confidance I had in myself. And sure I hit a couple of plateaus along the way but I stuck with keto and I can say it was well worth it. It's also well worth adding that I achieved these results would ever stepping foot in a gym or any kind of weight room. Periodically during summer quarantine I would go for a walk around my neighborhood but that's about all the exercise I would get that doesn't come from my normal job of being a waiter at a steakhouse.",1

Nothing serious. I was still debating whether to tell her about keto or not even as I walked into the office. I knew she would mention the weight loss. She is incredibly observant, which is why I like having her as my doc.

Sure enough, the moment I sit my ass in the chair she says 'You've lost weight'. I tell her I dropped 30 pounds in two months. She is very happy about that. Then she takes my BP, which was perfect at 128/76. Again, she is super happy. Then she asks about my blood glucose readings. I tell her the truth... Been in normal ranges now for two solid months. And then the dreaded question... 'How are you doing all this at the same time?'

I dunno why, but at that moment I said to myself... 'Ah frig it, what's the worst that could happen? Just tell her'. So I did. 

Well, she hit the roof... With excitement!!
She screams at me 'I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO SAY THAT!' with the biggest smile on her face. I couldn't believe the positive reaction. As the conversation went on, I began to realize... Holy shit! My doctor is pro keto!

She ordered a full panel of blood work as always, so we shall see how that goes. For now, I'm throwing this one in the WIN column!

KCKO!!!

Hey all,

I just wanted to share, semi-briefly, my experience with the Keto diet as a whole, and also provide a 'before' pic from the day I started, to a current 'now' picture to hopefully motivate, or encourage someone who is struggling. The keto diet is the best thing I have ever done my entire life, but I know that there have been countless times where I was ready to give up, and say SCREW IT! I am the last person I would ever expect to stick with a diet. I am here to say that, thanks mostly to this sub, and willpower I didn't know existed, I have reached my FINAL goal weight. I'm the happiest man in the world.

My whole life up until just after my 25th birthday was spent with a vicious addiction to food, and an extremely sedentary lifestyle. I had been overweight since I was a baby. Being ""fat"" was a fate I was resigned to, and that was that. As I grew older, so did my weight. From 2012-2017 I did not weigh myself. As my clothes got tighter and tighter, and my sizes increased, I did whatever it took to put that out of my mind and not remind myself of my growing weight. I remember the day I purchased sized 50 waist pants- it was a crushing blow to my psyche, and sent me into a spiral of depression and binge-eating. Something HAD to give. I WANTED to change- but could I?

That happened on April 5, 2017. That was the day I decided to change everything. This was the day I did the scariest thing I had ever done; I weighed myself for the first time in 5 years. I had expected it to be high, but I did not expect the scale would tip all the way up to 355lb. I was convinced this was wrong, that the scale was broken (HAH, what a rationalization that was), and went to Target and purchased a new scale. Once I set it up at my house, I took a deep breath, and stepped on. It read almost virtually the same exact number. I was crushed. I was beaten. I broke down in tears, telling myself that weight loss wasn't something that could happen for me. I was ready to say FUCK IT, and move on, and live my life in morbid obesity, and die young.

Luckily, none of that happened. After collecting myself, I did some research on diets. Now prior to this day, I had tried numerous diets over the years: The paleo diet, WeightWatchers, Calories In Calories Out (CICO), TheWhole30, and many more to no avail. I could not stick with anything more than a week or two. On this day, however, I found this subreddit. I read success stories, I learned about what being in ""ketosis"" meant, and above all, I found a few guys who posted before & after pictures who looked LIKE ME. They had the same measurements AS ME. ""Is this really doable?"" I thought to myself. Thank god it was.

I started immediately; got my food supplies (Lots of meat, veggies, cheese, and butter), and began my Keto Journey. After a rough transition into ketosis (Almost bailed numerous times for reasons directly related to the so-called ""keto-flu""), I finally started feeling GOOD. Waking up with CLARITY, and my mood was more consistently POSITIVE than it had ever been. I was skipping breakfast, and not feeling hungry until the afternoon. I was eating more than enough and the weight was pouring off.

In my first 5 months of Keto, I lost 60lb. This was the point where my doctor cleared me of immediate diabetes risk, I had more energy than I ever thought possible, and I was fitting into much smaller clothing. I was in heaven. I was ready to take it to the next level, so I started incorporating 2-3 hours of light cardio a week. The weight continued to POUR off.

As the months went by, it got harder and harder to lose weight. After the year mark (Where I was down almost exactly 120lb), I hit an intense plateau for almost 6 months. I wasn't gaining weight by any means, but I wasn't losing either. I was 50lb away from my final goal weight, and it seemed like this would never be attainable. This, paired with a knee dislocation rendering me unable to work out, derailed me. I said FUCK KETO AND FUCK THIS. I began to eat whatever I wanted, and began to move the scale in the wrong direction. This would be the case for nearly 3 months; I was convinced I would never get back to being on Keto, and I would be fat again. Then, I had an epiphany, or a moment of clarity; I could restart my Keto journey, incorporate some higher level workouts, and really apply myself to being all-in. And boy am I happy I did that. I began to LOSE weight again. Now, I had re-gained almost 20lb, so I had to knock that weight out, and then I kept going. I was more focused on what was going into my body, so I began logging every calorie that went into my body (Kept it at a moderately aggressive caloric deficit of around 1750 Net kcals a day), and as each new month went by, I became closer to my goal of 185lb. I was so close I could taste it.

And now, here we are. When I weighed myself and saw I was at 185.6lb I was in shock. I took a second, collected myself, and began to tear up. This coincided with the two-year mark of my Keto Journey. I was the happiest man in the world. Words can not express the amount of help, motivation, and happiness this sub provides. I am mostly a lurker, and wish I had engaged with people directly MORE, but the resources here are better than I have found anywhere else. I am so thankful for each and every one of you.

In closing, I am entering the final, most bittersweet phase of my Keto Journey: Saying goodbye to the keto diet. With the help of a nutritionist and personal trainer, I am going into the phase of toning, and packing on muscle. Now that I have lost the weight, now I am looking to pack on 10-15lb of lean muscle mass, and a more carb-centric diet is looking to be necessary for me to attain these goals. I am so excited for what the future holds, but I can say, with full certainty, that this Keto Journey saved my life. And I will forever be grateful for that.

1. Get a two-liter of Diet A&W Root Beer (or your diet soda of choice). 
2. Get some heavy whipping cream. 
3. Drink Keto cream sodas all day.

It's worked great, and I'd say I do it once/week or so. Compared to eating 1 block of cream cheese, or an egg and a piece of bacon every 3 hours, I'll take it.

&#x200B;

Hey everyone!

I'm so inspired seeing all of your success stories, so I figured it was time to post my full story.

The two photos here take place in very different parts of my life. The one on the left, was taken in July of 2017. It was the 4th of July parade in my neighborhood and I remember hating how I looked in the photo. The photo on the right was taken at a wedding about a month ago. But there is so much more to the story than the simple difference in weight.

&#x200B;

I was approximately 280-285 lb in February of 2018... Which was the highest I've ever weight and the beginning of the darkest chapter of my life (divorce). I honestly don't know how I got to be that heavy. I got married when I was 19 at 180 lbs and before I knew it, I had ballooned up about 100 lbs. It was truly a mixture of depression from an unhappy relationship, not caring about what I ate, and poor habits.

&#x200B;

I was a wreck. It was honestly the lowest point of my life and I wouldn't wish it upon my first enemy. The emotional rollercoasters of a divorce are devastating, especially when there are little ones involved. But blessings often have a way of appearing as tragedies. I realized that although I was going through the most difficult period of my life, I was somehow happier. I was free of a relationship that should have ended years sooner. And when I think back on it today, I thank her for setting me free. I would have never left otherwise and would probably still be where I was just a couple of years ago, weight wise and depressed.

&#x200B;

The first 20-30 lbs quickly disappeared once she initiated the divorce. I needed a way to channel my emotions, so I decided to capitalize on this opportunity and join a gym. A couple of months later and I was down a total of 50lb. I felt amazing. I was more confident and proud of all that I had accomplished. Then my weight plateaud at about 230lb. I couldn't lose anymore no matter what I tried. I felt like crap, groggy, tired, and couldn't concentrate. My eating habits were still poor and I was reverting back to old habits. The scale started to go the other way...

&#x200B;

A friend then introduced me to keto. I began researching like a mad man and fully committed. In October of 2018, I began my Keto kourney. I emptied my kitchen of all that was filled with carbs and sugar. I probably dumped around $300-400 worth of food that day. It was upsetting to see it go to waste, but liberating at the same time. Anything that symbolized my old eating habits went right into the trash. I then went to the store, bought a vacuum sealer and about $400 worth of food. Then came 2-3 hours of prepping myself for healthy meals. I saw great results right off the bat.

&#x200B;

About 2 months in, I was comfortable enough to reintroduce keto friendly versions of the foods I loved the most. Pizza, cookies, cheesecake, and more! My love for cooking meshed very well with my love for keto and I thoroughly enjoyed ketofying all of my favorite foods. Being able to do this gave me a whole new perspective on the keto lifestyle. It opened up so many doors and what resulted was a new framework of thinking that combined a happy and healthy lifestyle with great food and positive results. I was HAPPY. I was more AWARE. I was more ACTIVE. And most importantly, I felt balanced.

&#x200B;

Fast forwarding to today, the picture on the right was taken at a wedding about a month ago. I'm currently at 155lb. My pant size went from a 44 waist to a 28 waist. I've stopped obsessively stepping on the scale. I've stopped tracking macros to the EXACT CALORIE. At this point, keto is not a diet for me. It is a lifestyle. And a lifestyle that I am used to. I let my body does what it wants and as long as I stay true to the Keto lifestyle, I know it will treat me right. Some weeks, I gain 1-2 lbs. And then it comes right off. But I keep true to the fundamentals. I keep up the healthy habits. Keto is my life and will be for the foreseeable future.

&#x200B;

I started as an obese, depressed, and hopeless individual. I thought there was no hope. I thought there would be no light at the end of the tunnel. And I am so thankful that I was able to stick it through to today. I am proud of who I am today. Proud of who I am after a divorce. And proud of what I have accomplished on Keto. I could not have done any of it without your support, guidance, and success stories. With that being said, I figured it was time to post my own. Thank you /r/Keto for everything you've given me.

&#x200B;

I wish you all a Merry Monday. Keep Calm and Keto on.

My Keto journey (has come to an end),0,2m1bc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/2m1bc4/my_keto_journey_has_come_to_an_end/,10,1415790885.0,"HI all,

So here is my keto experience.  Some of you will relate, some of you will look down upon me, but ultimately this is my experience with the ups and downs of the lifestyle and how i plan to **QUIT** this Saturday.


##Weight Loss
Went from **87kg down to 78kg in 5 weeks**.  Weight just melts off and i was loving it.  I went from no abs to a visible 4 pack (CMON you remaining 2 abs...SHOW!).

I found i plateaued when i stopped exercising and just relied on diet....but this may have been a slight miscalculation on my Basal Metabolic Rate.

##Exercise

Got into Ketosis in 2 days (verified via the ketostix) and have not broken once.  Used tabata sprints (i recommend these for anyone trying to get fit), and also HIIT 30 run 30 walk.
I try and hit the weights in the gym every 2nd day (sometimes every 3rd), but usually run/jog/hike on the other days

##Diet

I used Keto in conjunction of leangains (8 hr eat window/16 hour fast...ate between 12-8)
mmm bacon.  Pretty much sick of bacon now though as I have it every lunch.  Standard day includes

* Lunch - 2 strips bacon, 1 low carb sausage, salad consisting of cashews, cheese and baby spinach with sour cream
* Dinner - more bacon, and a meat product (roast pork, chicken etc).
* Snacks - Cashews...LOVE cashews

Usually swapped out the salad for 3 boiled eggs and dinner having scrambled eggs with the meat.

Using MYFitnessPal showed me around the 1400-1700 calories (exercise not included - if i ran, i usually had another handful of cashews)

##Drawbacks

I enjoy an active lifestyle.  I go to the gym and participate in intense sports.  While i consider myself to be keto adapted now after 5 weeks, i feel so lethargic performing sports.  My running times have suffered, my lifts have decreased and i find it just bloody unmotivating to exercise under these conditions.  

Some might say i may not be Keto adapted yet...and this may be true, but i feel for me in the long run, Carbs will give me the energy that i require to fire at peak performance.

Another problem...i love breaded things.  I love chicken schnitzels, i love wraps, i love battered fish YUM YUM.  While i do not crave these any more, in all reality, i miss them.

**The main drawback is social awkwardness**.  
Family dinners involve me preparing special keto meals just for myself and watch my family munch down on dessert.  

Had a round of drinks shouted for everyone last night, mate gave me mine (Jim Bean and Cola)...couldn't drink it.  

At another BBQ, couldnt eat fruits or breads that were provided so just had 2 sausages.

I praise everyone that can keep a social face while constantly not feeling embarrased by knocking back peoples food and drinks.

***

##Why am i quitting?

I started Keto as i needed to lose weight to fit into my suit (best man at my mates wedding on Saturday).  I now fit and its fantastic....but how can i enjoy my mates wedding when they are drinking beers in the car (cant have beer), eating rice for dinner, and knocking back wedding cake.

This is just not the sort of lifestyle i want to continue.

So in all, thank you /keto for your brilliant help in getting me down almost 10kg in a quick timeframe!  But i now feel i can maintain this weight back on the carbs.

If i every climb back up to that old figure, i will dust off the ole /keto and join you all again (for a month or so) ;)",1

My NEW 30 Day Plant-Based Challenge - Vegetarian to Vegan,1,8vom8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/8vom8u/my_new_30_day_plantbased_challenge_vegetarian_to/,10,1530613955.0,"Hi r/PlantBasedDiet

This month I decided to challenge myself: A 30 Day Vegan Meal plan.

I wanted to address the topic of muscle building while on a vegan diet. Recently this past month, I put together a meal plan for myself that outlines specific amino acids in my diet. I plan to experiment for 30 days the effects of being on a strict vegan diet while training. From my own observation, my opinion is that there is a need for education relating to a vegan's approach toward athletic performance.

For disclosure, I am not a registered dietician or physician, but do believe in holistic health, overall wellness and longevity. From my experience dieting as an athlete, my own perspective has been shaped by the process of dieting for muscle growth and how to achieve optimal physical conditioning.As defined animal protein is noted as a '**complete protei**n', as it contains all of the essential amino acids that your body needs to function effectively ([https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/animal-vs-plant-protein](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/animal-vs-plant-protein)). These six are [arginine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine), [cysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine), [glycine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycine), [glutamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamine), [proline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proline), and [tyrosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine) (i.e., R C G Q P Y). Five amino acids are **dispensable** in humans, meaning they can be synthesized in sufficient quantities in the body. These five are [alanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine), [aspartic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid), [asparagine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asparagine), [glutamic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid) and [serine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine) (i.e., A D N E S).([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential\_amino\_acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_amino_acid)). Furthermore, each type of animal protein is made up of varying percentages of these types of amino acids ([http://www.jbc.org/content/148/2/431.full.pdf](http://www.jbc.org/content/148/2/431.full.pdf)). In other words, animal protein is made up of varying amino acids, but will contain all of the essential amino acids for muscular regeneration.For vegans however, plants are '**incomplete'** and do not contain all of our essential amino acids. Hence, plant variety is required to intake the requisite amino acids for muscular growth.

Currently, as a vegetarian, I have had great results with (1) a leaner, more structured muscular tone; (2) less body inflammation; (3) a comparative strength profile; and (4) a quicker recovery period.

Before I began this challenge, I analyzed my prior diet and researched the amino acid percentages of a moderate, animal-based protein regimen. In theory, this animal-based diet requires consuming high amounts of protein to maximize muscle recovery during post-athletic performance.

Next, I totaled the amino acid profiles derived from each animal-based meal. This becomes a benchmark for my protein intake while training for these next 30 days.My analysis and amino acid profiling begins as follows:

1. Determine my total amino acid intake on an animal-based approach
2. Calculate my **total milligram (mg)** intake per amino acid for the day
3. Substitute in my vegan-based diet plan
4. Calculate my amino acid profile for my vegan-based diet plan
5. Compare both profiles and see where I am deficient in amino acids (in milligrams) compared to my previous animal-based diet
6. Target specific plant-based food types that make-up for those deficiencies

Once I determined the correct food groups, it became a matter or adjusting my diet accordingly.I expect my challenge to last from 7/1 until 7/31 this month and I just wanted to post a current picture of my physique here in order to keep myself accountable for the next 30 days.Also, I have attached my current vegan diet plan to this post, and would be grateful to hear any feedback.

**EDIT:** 

Hi Everybody!

I posted this late last night and should have waited. Please see my new vegan diet and old animal based diet here: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xWzLPQzTclCgv6mnnm-JEmZaobN\_tdbp](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xWzLPQzTclCgv6mnnm-JEmZaobN_tdbp) (Please let me know if this link doesn't work)I just wanted to clarify a few things.

I understand that some plant-based foods are considered complete proteins (e.g. quinoa and buckwheat). However, what I discovered when I compared my old animal based diet to my plant based, vegetarian diet, was that I was eating fewer amino acids comparatively. In other words, in my plan linked above, 1 serving of 6 ouces of chicken contains **5,242 mg** of lysine, **4,508 mg** of leucine, and **2,032 mg** of histidine. 1/2 cup of quinoa, which is considered a complete protein, only has **442 mg** of lysine, **483 mg** of leucine, and **235 mg** of histidine.From my understanding, this would mean that you would have to almost eat 5 cups of quinoa to obtain the close to the same level of lysine compared to one 6 ounce serivng of chicken (which is a ton of carbs!).

So, I basically had to make sure I was within my macro limit for protein, carbs and fats, but am still hitting the same TOTAL amount of amino acids as I would be on a animal-based diet. I have also heard of the plant protein combining myth ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein\_combining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_combining)), but I am more concerned about getting an adequate amount of amino acids rather than varying the types of plants I am eating.

Please let me know your thoughts are thank you for the feedback thus far!

**TL;DR** : Maximizing muscular gains and balancing your macros (protein, carbs, fat) by making sure you're eating an equivalent amount of amino acids using plant-based proteins.

My girlfriend ordered chips, the burger and everything carb loaded under the sun. Not one time did I even flinch saying “man that looks good”. I looked at it as carb-crap. That’s my victory, I’m not craving carbs anymore, I have been without any type of carb for almost a month. No cheating, no okay maybe a spoon full of peanut butter to fit in my carb limit. It’s been it has carbs/ sugar not eating it. This is the most successful I have been so far.

Problem is now that with every victory, there is a downside. Last night I realized that my girlfriend is either intentionally or unintentionally trying to sabotage me. I had this revelation last night, and every time I have failed on this lifestyle change,  for the past two years, there seems to be more  junk food ends up at my house or in front of me, when I’m doing great.",1

My Parents Are Going To Lose Their Minds.,2175,axrt50,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/axrt50/my_parents_are_going_to_lose_their_minds/,293,1551857346.0,"I live 5.5 hours from my parents so I only really get to see them once or twice a year when I have vacation from work so I can spend a week there at a time. I last saw them May 2018. I started keto July 28th, 2018 at a starting weight of 378.2 lbs and have not told them that I am doing keto. As of this morning I am at 305.0 lbs! I am going to try to hit 100 lbs lost by the time I am set to go visit (May 18th) but even if I don't hit 100 lbs I know they are going to see a major difference. 

Everytime i talk to Mom on the phone she asks if anything is new and it is so hard not to tell her about my progress. The reason behind not telling her is that I have very critical and judgmental siblings and I don't want them filling my Mom's head with ""how bad keto is for you"". I want to show Mom that after almost 10 months, when I see her, that I am healthy, have more energy, and more importantly  I am starting to love me for the first time in my 36 years.

I want her to see that keto is a great lifestyle change and I am hoping that she and my stepdad will try it out. Mom is diabetic and overweight and my stepdad is overweight too so I think this change in lifestyle is exactly what they need to get their health back on track. I want them around for a long time. 

Have any of you hidden keto from family or loved ones? Did you get any negative reactions when you told them?",1

My Story... 487lb to 364lb so far...,1582,8wbb52,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/8wbb52/my_story_487lb_to_364lb_so_far/,128,1530833143.0,"Here's my story... I've always been heavy. Teased merciless in school until I left at age 16 to get my GED and started working. At age 16 I was 440lbs and my weight leveled off around 465lbs. In 2005 I started working out, lost down to 425lbs then hurt myself and gained it all back. This had been my gym cycle. Every year I would work out, lose down to about 425lbs, but months later it would all return. This continued until 2017, and I had two wake-up calls. One, my doctor said he refused to treat me for anything (cold, flu, etc) until I lost weight at 487lbs, this after giving me a clean bill of health (yes, nearly 5 bills and not on any meds because everything was normal.) Two, the birth of my daughter. I had grown uncomfortably comfortable in my heavy size, but I wanted to be able to play with my daughter and I wouldn't be able to keep up with her. I started cutting back on my intake, cut out every drink but water and started going back to the gym again. This time I started going every day, and worked my way up to doing an hour of cardio and hitting 10 machines every morning. This helped me lose some weight but I knew my food intake needed more modifications. A friend of mine started keto and wasn't working out half as much and had overtaken me in the little competition we had to see who could lose the most. My wife, was a skeptic and still is, but reluctantly agreed to change up things so I could do keto. My work day lasts from 7am until 6-7pm some days so I'm at her mercy for my night meal and she refuses to just cook for one. I was losing fast with keto and my workout but due to financial reasons she had to go back to work and works from 4a-11a so my 4am daily workouts had to stop. Nevertheless I refuse to take the elevator in the offices I work in and I park my car far away when I go to places trying to get as many steps as I can in and as of this week I finally have my mountain bike together with plans to start riding on the weekends we're both off. I started at 487 last May, yesterday I weighed in at 364. I still have a long way to go to hit my goal of 300lbs, which may get pushed to 250 as I proceed.

TLDR: was crazy fat for over two decades, couldn't lose it, had a baby, got really motivated, started working out daily, still not making progress, keto supercharged it and it's staying off, still got a long way to go.

My Twin Sister and I Have Lost 145 lbs on Keto So Far....

So many of your photos have inspired me over the years. 

[My sister and I](https://imgur.com/a/bi53LYm?fbclid=IwAR3Rq2_4LMGX6hZ_Y5njHmXjl-513MhViGp3FwH0HSfIbapZ5fF_Y-2bRvs) have battled our weight since the age of 13. We have had success on the keto diet in the past. I couldn't even tell you the amount of weight I have lost  over the last 15 years doing forms of the ketogenic diet....and gained back after I got off. (AT LEAST 200 lbs over the years)  I went from 282 lbs to 199 lbs and practically gave up, I still to this day don't know know why . I made a conscious decision to give up once I saw onederland. That was 8 years ago. I ended up gaining back 62 of those pounds again. When I was planning my wedding  I lost a bit of weight for the wedding, but not much (maybe 20 lbs). I ended up being completely uncomfortable on my wedding day. A friend paid for our photographer to travel to Riviera Maya Mexico as our wedding gift. We had a destination wedding with 50 guests. While it was a happy day, I look back at the pictures and all I remember feeling was fat and self conscious about how I looked. Years later I am now able to accept the way I looked in my wedding photos.

So when my twin sister started planning her wedding and decided that this was going to be the year where she actually lost the weight...I decided I had to get serious too. I knew that if she lost weight for her wedding, and I didn't that people would be comparing us on her wedding day while I stood up there next to her. People always compare us, it comes with the territory of being a twin. One of my first memories of this happening was when I was 12, and a parent of one of my friends asking how much more I weighed compared to my sister. When my sister said we weighed the same, the parent actually started arguing with her, telling her that it was obvious I was bigger. 

 We have had 4 people we know start Keto because of us, and are they happy and getting healthier and love the keto diet. Of course there are some haters, but after almost a year of being on Keto, they don't bother me much anymore. We typically do OMAD and lazy keto. I sleep soundly though the night now after years of sleepless nights. My eczema is gone. The crippling anxiety that I had for years is gone. We have lost a total of 145 lbs on keto so far. I now weigh less than I did when I was 13 years old. My goal weight is 150lbs. I am 5'11.

I know this will sound cliche... but hear me out. If we can do this, anyone can. Carbs completely controlled my life before. I would think about what carb filled garbage I wanted to eat for dinner, and while I was eating it I would think about the next meal. The secret to staying on keto and finally making the change is you have to be ready to do it. Ready to make the right decisions. It will take you a thousand decisions over the next year to get closer to your goal. And once you are on it for a week, a  month, a couple months those decisions will become natural to you. When someone offers (demands, begs, guilts)  you to eat something you shouldn't eat, you won't cave, no matter how hard they try. (I just had someone do this to me at my Christmas party on Sunday and I laughed.) 

I plan to be keto for the rest of my life. I really do not want to go back. I hope I can do it. I think I can.",1

My Watch has ended - 345 lbs down.,7809,bzz4i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/bzz4i0/my_watch_has_ended_345_lbs_down/,570,1560415274.0,"I wanted to make this post for anyone that's looking to start, has started but has fallen off or stalled or for anyone that's in the tail end of their journey to show that if you put your mind to it, you can achieve anything. I'm just an ordinary guy and I was able to hit my goals. Not always with ease but I was able to get through them.

This is a day that until recently I thought I wouldn't never see. I'm officially under 200 lbs.

I started at 545 lbs in January 2016 and today, in June 2019, I'm 199.8. If you would have told me 3 and a half years ago that I would be here, I would have laughed in your face but here I am. I went from a 7XL to wearing this nifty Medium Tall jacket. 

It wasn't always the easiest of things to do but instead of letting any setbacks or obstacles slow down or ruin my progress, I chose to use those as motivation to get through those times. 

I think I can honestly say that I've gained a life. I went from having trouble fitting into an airline seats,to as of recently being able to jump out of one to skydive. Im grateful for all the support along the way and for those that have supported be since the beginning.

After going through all this, I'm a firm believer that there isn't anything that can't be achieved by myself or anyone else as long as you put in some time, dedication and have a little determination (or stubbornness). Whether it's losing weight, finishing school, jumping out of a plane, getting that promotion, finding your dream job, asking that cute girl out, wrestling a bear, or climbing Everest. If you want something, go after it! ""God placed the best things in life on the other side of fear"" 

At 6'3 and 199 lbs, I think I'm finally at my stopping point. Now the challenge of maintaining. But for the mean time, to quote Jon Snow, ""My watch has ended"". #keto #weightloss #lowcarb #atkins #bacon

http://imgur.com/IY70bke

So 6 years ago, I was nearly 4 years sober off heroin, about to transfer up to Cal after graduating with high honors from a local Community College, and felt, deep down, terribly unhappy. You see, while off of drugs I had switched addictions to food, and while I had been slightly overweight for much of my life, by this time (age 26) I had ballooned from about 220 pounds, to just north of 400. I had gotten to the point that I would buy fast food meals from one drive- through, hide the bags so the next drive- through wouldn't see them, grab some more food there, and park on some dark, deserted street to gorge myself in shame. In retrospect it was so utterly pathological, but I guess it takes hindsight to really gain that sort of perspective. 

Anyway, so by that time I was living in Berkeley, and trying to go to classes my first semester. I couldn't fit in any of the auditorium seats (plus the hell of squeezing past already seated students to some solitary center seat with a dozen ""pardon me""s) or the desks (a single giant ass cheek and thigh would fit in one of those demonically- designed deskchair unit things, while the other took up an entire isle). I should mention I'm 6'2 and have a large frame as it is, so some friends tried telling me that I ""carried it well,"" which I know was just kind bullshit, and that the truth was I was rapidly eating myself to death. Not to mention, the social aspect of being so heavy. Let me tell you, the looks I would get from some people, the absolute disgust and contempt with which some would regard me. It was rarely overt, but just in their eyes, as they ""sized me up,"" in a literal sense. It's a very difficult feeling to contend with and I have a considerable amount of empathy for other folks struggling with obesity today. But it wasn't enough to get me to make any changes, and perhaps contributed to my overall depression that kept me consuming the way I had been.

With my newfound health insurance, I went to the campus health center (Tang, it's called) and got a GP to run up some blood work. I asked specifically for a referral to a surgeon for bariatric surgery, which, now insured, I had coverage for. I was done being morbidly obese, but I was insistent on taking the easy way out. Before he would sign off on it, he needed a full accounting of my weight and overall state of health. However, I maxed out the scale in the Tang Center, and the only one which could accommodate my mass was up in the Cal football training area. Thankfully there were only a handful of players in there, and the trainers knew ahead of time I was coming, otherwise my embarrassment likely could have proven fatal. Almost literally. When the number read 408 on the small, red digital screen, I mumbled something thanking them for their assistance, and walked (waddled, more accurately) out to my car as quick as I could manage. I remembered how devastating breaking the 300 level was for me a year and a half or so prior, which preceded a half-hearted attempt at going to the gym and dieting for a couple weeks, but the stretch marks spreading across my stomach told me I was failing and I gave up quickly.

400 was something else entirely. In my mind, 400 was the sort of weight they made reality shows about, the sort where my life expectancy was basically cut by two thirds, and where, if I didn't act quickly and with conviction, I could expect to never attain any of the things I wanted for myself in my life. No girlfriend, no children, no successful career... my weight would get in the way of all that, and sooner rather than later, it would kill me.

So I doubled down on the surgery idea. The Dr. agreed, especially when my blood came back showing I was ""pre diabetic"" with high cholesterol likely contributing to my high BP. I was prescribed some BP medication, and with a BMI in the 50s, I was a prime candidate for bariatric surgery and he wrote the referral. I had been doing extensive research on the most effective weight loss surgeries, and for someone as heavy as I was, it seemed to me that what is known as a ""vertical sleeve gastrectomy"" would be the ticket to the body I desired. This surgery, unlike a gastric bypass, stomach stapling procedure, or LapBand, is absolutely irreversible, and involves removing up to 80% of your stomach and turning it into a sort of banana shaped tube from it's natural pouch shape. And severing the vagus nerve, which is a bad idea on so many levels. Because of it's greatly reduced size, patients who have had the procedure often need to take tons of vitamins every day for the rest of their lives to make up for the reduction in available nutrients, as well as constantly sip tiny amounts of water throughout the day in order to remain properly hydrated, as gulping any liquids will often result in vomiting. In December of 2011, I met with the surgeon, got assessed, and scheduled the surgery for the following March. The pics he took of me are some of the few photos I have of myself at that weight, and I need to get them from his office, assuming I still can.

I should also mention that a month prior to this, and in a fit of desperation that began with me putting the barrel of my GP100 into my mouth one difficult evening, I had discovered the Silk Road and placed an order for some powder heroin, rationalizing my relapse by saying to myself ""hey, at least it's something new and not tar."" Of course, within a few weeks I was back using tar again anyway, but regardless I had thrown away my nearly 4 years of sobriety and was now in an even more dangerous position health- wise.

In January of 2012, and flush with cash from my financial aid, loans, scholarship, and selling my beloved manual Volvo S60 T5 (no need to drive with BART, CalTrain, busses, and living within easy walking distance of campus), I visited Santa Cruz to see an old friend and buy an ounce of dope, with the plan to flip it to pay for my burgeoning habit. When I walked into his house, I recognized an old friend from high school (one of his wife's best friends) sitting on the couch, and was immediately speechless at how gorgeous she had become. It had been a few years since we had seen one another, and while I had always thought she was cute (honestly, she was one of those chicks every guy was attracted to back in the day, very much a flirt but with a good heart nonetheless) I always just considered her out of my league. We talked for a couple hours, about how proud they all were at my success with school, about my foray back into drinking and smoking pot (the dope was a secret only me and my buddy knew about at this point, and she being a brief, former meth user and current pot smoker, understood I think), and about my weight gain and surgery I had scheduled for a couple months away. Before I left to go pick up my shit, we hugged goodbye and said we'd see one another again soon, and while on the way to meet the dope man I could think of nothing but this woman and how amazingly beautiful she was. The kicker was the fact that she had recently broken up with her boyfriend and was single, and while I didn't have any expectations on being able to get with her, I had to try.

I returned to my apartment in Berkeley with a piece of dope between my buttcheeks and thoughts of this girl in my head. It's difficult to describe the effect that our chance re-encounter had on me, but over the next few days she was all I could think about. I realized that remaining obese in the way I was currently would ensure I would never have a woman like that in my life, but it did something else to me. I often refer to that realization today as my ""epiphany,"" as that's essentially what it was, but I had this massive revelation that, since I was the one who got myself into this situation, I could be the only person able to get myself out of it. Nobody forced all those burritos, hamburgers, gallons of juice, and pizzas into my mouth, and nobody else was going to be responsible for losing the weight either.  

In hindsight it seems so obvious, but seeing her and how beautiful she was really drove home everything I was missing in my life due to my weight. So I jumped into action. First I went literally across the street from my apartment, where a collection of private Dr. offices were located, one of whom specializing in Subutex/ Suboxone. I paid out of pocket for a Subutex script, and detoxed in my apartment for a couple weeks off of the heroin, which I was intending on selling anyway. During that time, I devoured as much information on effective diets as possible, and that's when I first discovered keto.

To be honest, what I really found first was Atkins, although as I understood it, the lack of protein control initially advocated by this diet has some potential dangers. I was also interested in Paleo, which was relatively new if I recall correctly, and endeavored to create my own sort of hybrid diet between the two, essentially aiming to stay at an extended ""Induction"" phase of Atkins by getting less than 25g of carbs a day. Fresh off the opiates, I went shopping with a carb-restricted mindset for the first time and jumped into the diet headfirst. I was off to the races! I ate lots of bacon, eggs, avo, salads with olive oil and a bit of balsamic. For occasional treats I had a bag of strawberries in my freezer, and would eat a few of those as a sort of dessert. The switch in my drinking habits was most substantial; I was resolutely against anything other than water, considering I used to easily. go through a gallon of juice a day. But I was surprised at how satisfying the sparkling water could be, both the lightly flavored variety but even just plain Pellegrino and the like. I was also impressed with how good I felt generally, and how sharp my mental acuity appeared to be while on my diet. People have often held me to be of above average intelligence, but there was a definite added benefit in this regard while eating this way. I bought some of those ketone test strips to help me stay motivated and know that what I was doing was effective, and began with a light excercise routine.

I started by walking a couple miles each day to a and from my classes, but within weeks I was up to 5 a day, and soon 10. I had (and still do) what amounts to a lifetime membership at 24 hour fitness ($20/ year, one of those awesome deals they apparently don't offer anymore) and started going there a couple days a week, but my walking routine around a number of blocks at night was definitely my primary workout.

At about 5 weeks in, and with my clothes noticeably looser, I decided to weigh myself for the first time. I headed down to the gym, looked hard for a moment at the scale, and held my breath as I stepped on. The screen flashed a moment, calculating, and then read 363 pounds. I had lost 45 pounds in little over a month! While I figured some of this was water, I was still excited beyond words, stepped off the scale, and went back to my apartment. These were the sort of results I had always needed to keep pushing me along, and they ensured my journey was further reinforced. I was even more diligent about sticking to my routine, and I put an indefinite hold on the scheduled surgery.

By late April, I was down to 291 pounds (still have the Facebook post to prove it, ha). Over 100 pounds in 4 months. Once I reached around 240, I seemed to hit a plateau, and so headed in to the Tang Center to try and get some pharmacological assistance. The same GP who had referred me to the surgeon walked into the examination room and took an approving look at me. ""So, I see you had the procedure, how's it going for you?"" He naturally assumed I had the VSG, and as I explained that I had cancelled the surgery and lost the weight via carbohydrate restriction, his shock was obvious. I've never seen a physician so happily incredulous in my life, and as I asked whether this was a healthy eating routine, he stated plainly that I should ""Keep doing whatever it is you're doing, you've just added 30 or 40 years onto your lifespan dude."" He was even happy to write a prescription for the weak amphetamine analog I asked for by name to help break through the plateau, which in my experience is rare for Doctors to do, although I later found that cycling off and back on a ketogenic diet broke through much more effectively. He also took my blood again, and I was no longer pre-diabetic, my cholesterol was normal, and my BP was in a healthy range and so I could come off the metoprolol.

There was a bunch of stuff that happened during this time, and the years since... my failures around dope and addiction, having to do a medical withdraw from Cal to go back to rehab, eventual homelessness following another relapse, IV use, overdose, and consistent criminality. My lowest weight was a sucked up 170; ironically too skinny for my size. But I've got 5 months sober today, am back working a strong program in a 12 Step fellowship, and am back on a ketogenic diet when my weight grew from 200 to 240 in my first 4 months of sobriety. I'm back down to 220 though, and know with conviction that I am absolutely in control of my body. I feel good, all things considered, and I like the direction my life is headed. 

Oh yeah, that girl. It would be too perfect to be able to say we got in a relationship with one another, but she picked up another boyfriend shortly after our initial encounter (he another friend from high school and a great guy altogether). They've been together for 5 years now, and I couldn't be happier for both of them. Tomorrow (Sept 3rd) will be my 3 year anniversary with my girlfriend, who is also sober today, and I wouldn't trade her with that initial girl for anything. I think life often works out exactly the way it's supposed to in the end, and as my mom says, 50% is given & 50% is claimed. You just have to find that resolve to claim yours, and the rest falls into place naturally. Don't give up on your journey, and know you absolutely have the power to achieve your goals, no matter what they might be. ",1

It's fairly well researched but feels half baked. Unfortunately, I'm not as well versed in ATP conversion etc:

""Just a theory, but still interesting to me: It seems like there's two primary ways to use energy from food for ""metabolism."" Way #1.) Turning food into ATP which you use to fuel bodily functions like moving around, general living, etc. Way #2.) Bypassing ATP creation and generating actual body heat through mitochondrial uncoupling. It *appears* that if you eat less for a long period of time you get better at making more ATP and become more ""efficient"" at creating that type of energy. At the same time, you seem to lose some of the ability to make heat through mitochondrial uncoupling. So when you go too low calorie and/or carb for too long you can end up feeling colder with cold hands and feet, and literally a lower core body temperature as well. And the increased efficiency at creating ATP can make it so you need less calories to survive, and any increase in calories above what you're now ""used to"" can lead to rapid fat gain. End result? Eating too little calories and/or carbs for too long can make you really efficient at storing fat, and really cold.""

He is on 6 medications from no medications even though he was skinny and never showed symptoms it turns out he had HBP and high cholesterol. His diet was almost totally rice, beans, bread, meat, and coffee. Almost no dairy but still atrocious. 

The medications are causing side effects like ED and fainting and I really hope to get him off of almost all of them, especially the one causing the ED (we were wanting a second baby) and fainting. 

At first he gave me a hard time with meat and flavor of food because there is foods he had eaten his whole life (Puerto Rican) that I don’t want him eating anymore but after finding out he couldn’t have sex his opinion changed and he wants to try a no meat no oil lifestyle. 

I want to know how much this diet had helped you? Did you get off of all or most of your medications? How did you get over the intimidation of jumping into it?

I have read online a lot but I am overwhelmed by recipes that are too fancy and bored of just frozen veggies and rice. How do you get over the “meat is the center of the meal” mentality? I also have severe adhd and I find it more overwhelming and difficult to try and organize meals but I’ve always wanted to learn and if I want him to live I have no choice so any advice on other unorganized people doing it is great. 

Also for Hispanic PBWF eaters, how can I keep the traditional foods still around for him so he doesn’t feel intimidated?

I was the guy who asked about some keto foods during a week long fast. Well, it didn't go that well and I started eating non-keto two days ago. I knew I wanted to eat some traditional Greek easter treats that we only eat once a year, so I decided to take a few days off keto after more than three months of no cheating at all. It was a valuable experience for many reasons. (Disclaimer: I'M NOT TELLING YOU TO CHEAT)

Everytime I read someone on here writing about cheating it sounded like they were almost dying after they ate something carby. That made me fear carbs to an irrational degree. Like, if I accidentally eat something carby I'll pass out. That was a pretty stupid assumption I guess. So here's what happened to me: The first time I ate carbs, my head started aching. It was unpleasant. The second time (and forward) it was like someone was punching my stomach. I spend A LOT of time in the bathroom (if you know what I mean) during the last few days. My teeth feel dirty for the first time since I started eating keto and my sleep got worse.

All in all, it's not worth it. Sure, chocolate tastes great and all, but man, am I happy to go back to eggs, bacon and no sugar again. It was a valuable experience for me, now I and my family know what happens to me if I cheat. But for now excuse me please, I'm off eating bacon. cheese and running a few kilometers. Gotta turn on keto mode again. :)

My sleep would be not 100% stable but I would recall dreams and on some days feel OK, on other would be 80% but I could manage it as I was completing enough sleep cycles.

Since the beginning of last week (I'm about 1 month into keto), **I've been feeling drowsy around 18:00-19:00 every day this week**, going to sleep around 12am, waiting to fall asleep for about an hour, **waking up around 4-5am**, forcing myself to go back to sleep and wake up feeling dead at 7:30. The past night I entered panic mode as the entire last week I was 50-50 about this issue thinking it might be mental or related to cortisol/low blood sugar.

Everyday I measured ketones and sugar, waking up with a blood level of 75-80. with ketones: 0.9-2.2.

Now, for me, sleeping less than 8 hours really impairs my ability to think, concentrate, work and live. I hate life on lower than 8 hours of sleep. My brain doesn't repair, and I feel my IQ drops 50 points. This week I didn't function, couldn't work and felt super fatigue. I'm about to blow keto.

I first thought it is related to a meal I was eating, until one evening I fall asleep on the sofa and woke up two hours later recalling a dream which is very weird for me. Than I thought it might be cortisol spikes due to low sugar. I know understand it is probably my circadian.

Everyday I supplement 400mg of magnesium, either Glycinate or regular. I also supplement 15-20mg of zinc.

I drink bone broth daily and the past few days I'm adding 2 teaspoons of potassium (salt substitute) and sodium to my water. This is not electrolyte deficiency. Unless I need to get even more sodium/potassium (I'm getting about 2000+-mg of potassium and 4000mg of sodium min').

On top of that I eat 0.5 pound of steak everyday + cream/butter + fatty fish + other type of fatty meat and sometimes I eat eggs. Avoid any kind of carbs. Eat some green leafs and that's it. Everything is cooked with Himalayan salt.

I stopped eating around 18:00pm everyday this week. Eating in a 8-10 hours cycle.

What am I supposed to do? I can't live like that. I need to sleep regularly. It is 5am where I live, and I don't see how I'm starting my week this way.

**EDIT:**  My HDL to triglyceride ratio is the perfect 2:1 (or is it 1:2?  Can't remember now) ratio, btw.  That also kinda confused him, because my LDL is high, which, according to him is accompanied by hypertension, high triglycerides and a HDL to trig ratio.  ",1

I'm finally getting back on the wagon. At my heaviest when I was eating my stress, I was 203 lb. I'm 5'5"", so yeah, not great.  I started keto after I had already dropped a few pounds with reduced intake and exercise.

I just got my labs back and a note from my doctor (who is also an old friend). Cholesterol was up due to the 'bad kind' (I know that's not an end all be all label and don't know if posting the numbers is asking for medical advice/FAQ no-no), and his instructions were basically, ""this is probably genetic. Exercise 5x a week, stick to a low carb diet, start some fish oil and see me in January.""

I'm a meat and potatoes guy. I don't like a lot of veggies, but I am experimenting and learning (and checking the nutritional info). I've got radishes and leeks to go with a pork roast I'm making today.

I consider this a on the road to success and on the road to my GW of 175. I weighed in at 187 today. I really didn't have keto flu this time and I can already tell I am sleeping better.",1

Her childhood and upbringing didn’t encourage physical activity and promoted lots of unhealthy eating habits. She’s a small framed girl (5’3”) but she’s around 35-40% body fat, last time we checked. She denied her weight problem for a while because nobody brought it up to her. But once she came to terms with it (the body fat measurements are hard to refute) we started brainstorming solutions. She’s decided to try the keto diet recently and started it a couple weeks ago. Recently she got those urine test strips. We tested her pee, and mine for a benchmark. I’m not in ketosis, which is expected, but she is! Which is awesome! 

So now the question is this: what does she do now? She’s never been really experienced with physical training and gets a lot of anxiety with working out because she doesn’t really know how. Bringing her to the gym with me has been more of a struggle than I hoped for. She was taking classes at her local gym for a while, but her extremely busy schedule makes that more difficult now. We started going for walks and counting steps a few days ago. Should she stick with that for a while or should she do more?

I’ve always been very physically active so I’m not sure how to approach a situation with such an inexperienced beginner like this, and I feel like I can’t help her as much as I should. Does anyone have any suggestions, maybe if you were in a similar situation? Any help would be extremely appreciated. Thanks everyone!

Edit: I’m sorry if anyone feels that I made this about me. After reading it back to myself, I can see how it may look that way. She wants to work out and get in shape, she is very motivated, she just doesn’t really know how to get started. I’ve tried offering as much help as I can, but it is proving difficult, and I thought this was a good place to get some tips. From the responses so far, it seems like the diet is going to be fine by itself for a little while, and it may be best to start off slow with the exercise and just let the diet do its thing. I will forward this information to her.",1

I’m so happy and surprised that it finally fits and I just wanted to share with everyone!

Getting a goal outfit was my main motivation. I bought this dress because my size (3X) was always sold out. So I decided to get it 3 times smaller and held onto it until I reached that size. Such a motivational thing for me.

Eggs fried in butter or bacon grease practically every day of his life. Fruit was only occasionally, and usually just berries from the yard. Snacks consisted of nuts that he would shell, then lick and dip in a plate of salt or maybe some radishes and more salt. Dessert was an occasional (and I mean occasional) cookie that he would put some butter on (thought it was weird until he had me try it) or a scoop of full fat ice cream. He didn't drink alcohol...beverages were water, fresh (I guess you'd call it ""raw"" now) milk, or some sun tea. 
He drove himself to California from Iowa when he was 90. He was still doing the Sunday crossword until he passed. Never had a heart attack or diabetes. Was never overweight. Had all of his original teeth. Only wore reading glasses.

It shocked me into taking better care of myself. 

I started at 650 lbs. 

I'm now at 530 thats a whole 120 lbs so far.

I have always been big. my whole life. I weighed 500 lbs in highschool. Im 30 Now. 

I wore size 9 mens shoes in grade 2. 

I'm the only large person in my family. 

Before i would be depressed like 4 days out of the week. 

Now its one day a week if that. 

I was on numerous diets as a child and growing up, you name the fad diet i tried it. 

Keto actually stuck, Its working and i can't wait for the rest of my life.

I know the next couple years are going to be tough but i can do it. 

Ive started walking which before was hard as hell to do. 

I'm starting to like life for once. strange as that sounds. 

Im only 31 lbs from being under 500 lbs. IM PUMPED

I figured I'd share my number one tip that may be overlooked but basically allowed me to keep up on keto, saved me tons of money not eating out and is generally just the best decision I made during this time.

For some it might be common sense, but for others it might be worth thinking about.

Simply, keep your kitchen clean. Keep your dishes clean. Always, always have a clean cooking space. It is infinitely easier to have the motivation to prepare and eat good food when you don't have that looming need to do a ton of tidying up hanging over you.

If you're struggling keeping up the motivation to cook, and you look over and see a messy space, this might be the reason why.

Anyway, thanks for the motivation!",1

This is one of the first times I’m posting here looking for a solution or to see if anyone is having similar skin problems.

I’ve been following keto pretty strictly for 5 weeks now. I’ve noticed in the first two weeks I got a red rash on my stomach and back. Little red spots that eventually turned from red to tan and feel like dry patches (they still have not gone away) they don’t really itch maybe once in a while but nothing horrible. They’re not very pretty though so I would like to try to get rid of them. 

Over the last couple weeks I’ve noticed my skin on my arms legs and face are so so dry. Dry to the point where I shower at night, put on tons of cream on my arms and legs and then wake up in the morning with flakey dry skin! I don’t understand why, I used to have really soft smooth skin that was rarely ever dry. 

I do try to drink a lot of water but maybe I’m not drinking enough? could this be the reason for these symptoms? Or anyone else have something similar? I don’t want to quit because I am feeling good otherwise and losing inches too. Any help / advice would be appreciated, thank you!",1

**Diet**: Held a ~30% deficit (1700cal/day) for the first 4-5 months, this is where a majority of the weight came off. (275 -> 225)

Then I relaxed the diet but only for beer, binge drinking about 4-7 times per month. Stayed strict about solid carbs though <30/day, but I would obviously bounce out of keto after a night of drinking. My body has become accustomed to going in and out of keto, I know it's not the fastest way to lose weight with the diet but it fits my current lifestyle.

I love how much more energy I have and how even hours after a meal I still don't feel hungry!

**Exercise**: I play basketball about 2-3 times a month, gym once a week lol and Golf/Disc golf about 3-4 times a week. So not much weight loss oriented exercise, I'm planing to lift weights now that I hit my weight goal. I might be biased but my athleticism and flexibility has improved remarkably. I'm still a weakling in the gym though. 

**Mental**: At the start of the diet I wanted to change how I was living. Going to bed at 4 or 5am, easily eating up to 3000+ calories a day. Depression, Anxiety ect.. I started the diet about a month before biting the bullet and going to see a GP and talking about my issues. Got prescribed welbutrin and started seeing a therapist. Easily one of the hardest things I've ever done but also one of the best. I never thought I could feel this good about myself. Keto was the kick-start I needed to start caring about myself. 


**Other**: 1 month ago I got the first real hair cut of my life, took me about a week to build up the courage to go to a real barbershop.  But it was so worth it.

I've changed out a large portion of my wardrobe, mostly because none of it fit me anymore! But also I was wearing the same stuff everyday, now I love my new clothes, shout out to /r/malefashionadvice . 

I also started a simple /r/SkincareAddiction routine. Using sunscreen when I know I'm going to be outdoors has made the biggest impact I think. Though I have yet to try and target my red cheeks, with what I think is rosacea. 

My friends are still perplexed at how I've lasted this long without bread lol. But that's not going to stop me from continuing keto!",1

I could barely do the 6 minutes straight of jogging at this time after doing the program for several weeks. The right is me today, at 221 (basically just above 100kg). I had done 2.5 miles of jogging in the the 25 minute range, I can now maintain this on good days for over 4 miles straight. 

Summary: Less sweat, more face gains, fewer chins. I’ve gone from a 6’3 guy wearing XXLT, 42/44 Jeans that were probably too tight, 46-48 waist Slacks, 54L suit, 18+ inch neck to Large Tall shirts (or XL/L depending on how long), 36 jeans, 42L-44L suits. 

If you’re on the fence about this diet, just do it. Try it for a few weeks maintain your macros fairly religiously. Don’t beat yourself up if you have a bad day, just get back on your horse and do it the next day. If I can lose over 110 pounds on it, you can have success too.

I'm 7 months into my keto journey and while me and the body scale are very close friends, the victory I'm celebrating has nothing to do with the scale. For the first time in my adult life, my clothes don't have an X in front of their size! On the left I'm 315+ pounds (with bike shorts underneath to ""hold me in""), and on the right I'm 205 (with a knot tied behind my back so it didn't drape)! 

I can't believe I've come this far. I can't believe I'm still going. I can't believe this is so simple. Less than 20g of net carbs per day, and I am finally seeing the changes I denied myself for so, so long. 

If you've arrived at this post and are thinking of starting, just do it. I browsed for a long time before jumping in, and I remember feeling simultaneously inspired and intimidated, thinking it was possible for other people, but maybe not me. I'm so grateful I decided to prove myself wrong.

I'm three weeks into this current attempt, and I donated blood today. The proper advice to follow is to eat a big meal beforehand, but I intermittent fast and don't really have time to eat big during the day anyway, so my ""big lunch"" on my way from one job to the other was a few handfuls of walnuts. My blood appointment was immediately after job#2, so I had a diet Dr. Pepper on hand and headed in.

I felt a little wonky while giving, but had already anticipated needing a snack afterwards. I left nothing to chance and brought my own. Lorna Doon cookies are 20g for the whole pack (4 cookies). I ate two, gingerly. I felt the carbs hit immediately, and felt much better. I stopped. I put the rest in my purse to not be rude. I threw them out when I got home.

A little quick background: I've been on a Keto diet since September 12 and have been very diligent about counting macros and all that. In addition I've been exercising daily and am down 33 lbs. I feel great mentally and physically for the first time in years.

Now, yesterday I officiated a wedding and, as is expected, there was not really any keto options at the reception other than pulled pork with no BBQ sauce. I had already decided that I would be courteous and eat, but was really anxious about overeating because that's something I've struggled with in the past. There was a lot of great food but I DIDN'T DO IT. I had one plate of food with reasonable helpings and even limited my dessert.

Today is my off day from the gym and I don't even feel any guilt and that is HUGE for me. I'm just so excited that I was able to control myself for a meal. Anyway, have a great Sunday everyone!",1

I started Keto on June 15th: SW 131.3 kg (288lbs) CW 103kg (226lbs) GW FIT. And since then I've been pretty militant on tracking everything and holding myself accountable. 

For the last two 3 months I had been going on morning walks (10km hikes through the woods), Today a older lady who lives down the block was out waiting for her mail (I assume - as the vans were down the street). As I was coming back from from the store with today's fixings and my walk and I say ‘Dobry Den’ (Hello in Czech) and she says it back and the something else. I took my headphones out to engage and tell her I don’t understand/English; so she says in English ‘You’re so slim’ while motioning with her hands slimmer.

The people around here do not speak English (I've had plenty of interactions that have required me to pull out a translator on my phone or play charades), or at least that probably wouldn't be a phrase that someone would have at the ready. So my take away from this is that she's seen me on my walks over the summer, seen my progress, and took the time to learn the English phrase to be able to congratulate me on my progress. That makes me feel damn good. 

Progress may be fast, progress may be slow, you might not see the progress yourself until others comment on it. But if you keep at it it will happen.

I’ve been researching endlessly for the best diet long term and Dr Bulsiewicz and his amazing book fibre fueled is what made my decision for me. Diversity of plants!!! 

He does mention that the transition can take time for someone with a sensitive/damaged gut. I haven’t really been ramping up the fibre/legumes gently, I’ve actually been eating probably a little too much. 

Just wondered if anyone else experienced the same thing and whether it just went away without restrictions to fibre/legumes or will I have to adjust my quantities. 

Seeing a GI next month. My biggest fear is I may have SIBO and I may be making matters worse. I take a prebiotic and a probiotic.

It’s been 6 days short of 2 months and I’m down 45.5 pounds already! I’m curious to see if I’ll hit 50 pounds by that 2 month mark, but I won’t be disappointed considering how much I’ve already lost. 

Before keto, I never thought any of this would be possible. I was staring dead into the eyes of weight loss surgery, feeling like a failure for being unable to keep the weight off myself. Every time I tried, the weight would come right back on and I would give up on myself easily. But this time, the results have got me hooked. 

There are days when I want to give up. There are days where I just want some pasta, chicken wings, and a good bowl of ice cream, but more often there are days where I look in the mirror and am satisfied with the changes I see. 

This week I discovered that I have a jaw line under my facial fat. I discovered that my back fat that has taken over my bottom for years is disappearing, and I discovered that I have dropped from a size 26-28 (depending on the store) to around a size 22. This week, I learned that size is changeable and that if you want something bad enough that you have the power inside of you to make it happen. 

I still have so far to go, and I know the road will only get harder from here, however I know that I can do it. I know that I can reach my goals. I can’t wait to see how I leave 2018, because I’m going to kick it’s butt.

I am new to Reddit and was thankful that a KETO sub exists! Offering a plethora of knowledge! My brother and I have been on the KETO diet for the last 3 months, going on 4. 

We usually eat once a day, consisting of a heavy fatty meal with moderate protein. Carb intake is maybe 10 grams a day if that. Usually its an omelet for me with extra cheese and avocado. Sometimes I will splurge and get a protein style burger from In-n-Out. Luckily I live in Southern California haha. Inadvertently we fast intermittently. 

We work out every day, primarily heavy weight lifting. With a little cardio, consisting of stair master or inclined walking on the treadmill. It is quite tough due to not having any carbs before our workout, but we just deal with it and push ourselves. 

I run a pretty good caloric deficit as does my brother. I haven't checked my weight in over 4 years and do not plan on doing so either, as I am a firm believer in ""looking good and feeling good."" As the number is arbitrary. 

Could anyone give me any advice on what we are doing, to enhance our KETO journey?

My eighteen-year-old got called over by our neighbor and asked if I'd lost weight. My daughter said yep, sixty-five pounds in nine months. The neighbor went to on to say: ""Please apologize to your mum for me. She came around to my house a few weeks ago to ask who trimmed our trees and I didn't know who she was. I would have invited her in if I'd known it was her.""

EDIT: My gosh, thank you everyone for your comments and 'likes'. Someone asked about crinkly skin around my neck at my age. So I'm including a few images, so you can see for yourself. The first two were taken back in May 2018 (I'm the one in the middle with the flowery dress taken at my mother's funeral with all my cousins). Giving my mother palliative care for the last six months of her life was the impetus for me changing mine and getting healthy. Two days after this picture I flew back to the US and started Keto. The after pictures were taken last month when my daughter and I hiked the Grand Canyon.

However, you guys seem like you know what you are doing, so I'd like some advice.

I (36/F) have always naturally gravitated towards plant-based eating.  I have been a pescatarian since I was 11.  Over time, I slowly lost my appetite for seafood and now I am finding that I just like the way my body feels when I omit dairy.  I'd like to transition to a plant-based diet but have some ""hang-ups"" about it.

I know how to choose healthy plant-based foods and how to select the ""right"" carbs.    My biggest issue is that I can't get past the feeling of ""higher carb / lower protein = BAD"".  For some context, I've been a gym rat for awhile.  I am now a Pilates Instructor but used to spend most of my time powerlifting.  My coach (who is a woman) told me that 50-100g of carbs would be sufficient for me and that I should be eating 150+ grams of protein at 135lbs.  I was never training for hypertrophy and I am not a bodybuilder.  I was just training for functional strength and enjoyment.  She knew all of this.  I know that the advice is ridiculous, but spending so much time in that world, watching people come into the gym with their lean chicken in their tupperware, has twisted my internal logic about how I should be eating.

Can someone please recommend some good macros I could follow if I were to transition to a plant-based diet?  Again, I am not a bodybuilder.  I just want to have good functional strength and a relatively lean body.  Any advice would be appreciated!",0

Is one banana a day, or half a banana a day viable if we can fit it into her macros?  Or would that many carbs at once completely knock her out of ketosis?

Newbies--Welcome To Your New You,1630,abf3sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/abf3sp/newbieswelcome_to_your_new_you/,551,1546347310.0,"Hello Newbies and Lurkers and welcome to r/keto!!!  I am EXCITED for you!!!  Excited that you are determined to do something about your health.  Does this sound familiar:  ""I have GOT to get healthier this year!!!""  And because of this declaration, you are now perusing r/keto.  WANTING to jump in.  WANTING to get healthier.  WANTING to be happier.  WELCOME TO r/keto!!!

First and foremost, is eating a ketogenic diet difficult.  Well, I eat keto, and I am dumber than a box of rocks.  So, start by reading this:    [Beginners](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/keto_in_a_nutshell)  Go ahead and read it now, I'll wait for you.

...

.......

............

Are you back?  Well, I'm going to go ahead and continue.  So, what the hell did you just read?  Well, a lot of stuff, so allow me to crystalize it for you:

First, eat fewer than 20 grams of net carbs a day.  This will ensure that you are in ketosis and ketosis is pretty much the point of a ketogenic diet.

Second, be prepared to drink more water.  You are going to be tinkling quite a bit initially, so you will need to replace that old water with new water.  So, just be prepared.

Third, if you begin to feel ""flu-ish"", you will need to supplement electrolytes.  ""What the heck????""  It's ok, it's not difficult.  In fact, read this [Electrolytes](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq#wiki_adapting_to_a_low_carb_lifestyle)  The easy explanation is that eating this way will probably require you to supplement your electrolytes a bit.  Also, take a minute and do a search on here for ""ketoade"".  I won't tell you what to do, but I will advise you to be prepared.     Also, the electrolyte  section is part of a larger FAQ.  You NEED to read the FAQ a couple of times.  Doing so will save you from some unnecessary angst.  Also, ask your questions here.  Ask them in the comment section of this post.  We will make this post a question and answer super duper mega thread.  One place you can refer to so as learn more about this way of eating.

Fourth, determine how much you should eat each day.  Click on this link:  [Macros](https://calculo.io/keto-calculator)  Set your carbs to 20 grams by checking the ""expert"" box, set your activity level to ""sedentary"" and set your caloric deficit to 20%.  By doing these three things, you will be in ketosis and you will lose weight.

Fifth, are those macros that you just calculated.  You need to eat fewer than 20 grams of net carbs a day.  Eat below your fat macro.  Seriously, you do NOT have to reach your fat macro.  In fact, you do NOT need to try to reach your fat macro if you don't want to.   The final macro is protein.  Protein is different.  You want to eat enough protein to REACH or EXCEED your protein macro.  Why?  Because you don't want to lose muscles.  You want to lose fat.  And very very very simply put, your muscles will help you burn fat.

Eat fewer than 20 grams of net carbs a day.

Drink more water.

Supplement electrolytes.

Calculate your macros.

Stay below your carb and fat macro.  Reach or exceed your protein macro.

Sort r/keto by ""new"" rather than ""hot"".  You will gain a great deal of knowledge by doing so.  Just trust me.

By doing the above 6 things, you will be eating a ketogenic  diet and will also begin to lose weight.  YAYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

""Why did you write that goofy stuff about the NEW ME???""  Well, because if you do the above things, several things will happen.  You will begin to lose some weight.  You will begin to feel hope.  Hope that this way of eating will ACTUALLY work for you.  Hope that you might actually make changes.  Hope that you might lose weight.  Hope that you might get healthier.   Hope that you will no longer be a slave to food.  HOPE.

After eating this way a bit longer, that HOPE will begin to evolve.  No longer just budding, that hope will bloom into CONFIDENCE.  This will be a magical day for you.  You will feel confidant that YOU WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.  You will no longer hope, but rather, you will KNOW that you will succeed.  It is at this time that you learn to respect yourself.  Learn that you are an unstoppable force.  YOU WILL LEARN THAT YOU WILL NOT BE BEATEN!!!  It will be a magical day because on that day, you will understand that you are a NEW YOU!!!

You are sitting there.  Looking at your phone.  Looking at your computer screen.  Worried.  Scared.  Doubts swirling through your mind.  PRAYING that you can find some magical words on here.  Some words that makes it all ""click"" for you.  I don't know if you will find those words.  I don't know what words to type to help you.  I do know that if you commit to eating this way, you will not need magical words.  I know that if you commit to eating this way, you will change.  Physically you will get smaller.  Emotionally you will get stronger.  Nothing magic.  You will do the work.  Keto will be your tool.

You are scared.  I am excited.  You are worried.  I am confident.  You have doubts.  I have confidence.  You don't know me.  Fair enough, you don't know me.  But rest assured, I have already walked your path.  I know the pitfalls.  I know the traps.  I will NOT allow you to fail.  r/keto will NOT allow you to fail.  Right now, r/keto has 960,766 members.  But members is the wrong word.  960,766 friends.  Friends who KNOW you will succeed.  Friends who WANT you to succeed.

Newbies and Lurkers.  Commit to eating this way.  Keto won't fail you.  I won't fail you.  r/keto won't fail you.  Your 960,766 new friends won't fail you.  You are scared.  We are excited for you.  Joyous for you.  We know you will succeed.  We know what you can do.  We know that you can become the person of YOUR dreams.

* Macadamia nuts are great, but also [fbombs macadamia butter](https://www.dropanfbomb.com/products/fuel-macadamia-and-coconut-butter-blend-with-sea-salt) for on the go.
* Realgood [enchiladas](https://www.realgoodfoods.com/product/beef-enchilada/) wrapped in chicken instead of tortillas. They sell these at CVS in my area. They also have pizzas but those don't taste as good as the quest ones IMO.
* Palmini [""pasta""](http://eatpalmini.com/) \- it's just hearts of palm cut to pasta shape. This tastes better than i expected it to be and is less work than shirataki noodles (although it does have more carbs).
* Silver Palate [tomato sauce](http://www.silverpalate.com/product/pasta-sauce/san-marzano-marinara). Most tomato sauces have added sugar or can be super expensive, this one i just discovered and is reasonably priced, available in grocery stores in my area, and has a simple short ingredient list.
* no-sugar-added [ketchup](https://www.primalkitchen.com/products/organic-unsweetened-ketchup) and basically all the other primal kitchen stuff too esp the salad dressings.
* dang [coconut chips](https://dangfoods.com/products/unsweetened-lightly-salted-keto-paleo-coconut-chips), way better tasting than other coconut flakes/chips. Even my kids love 'em. Only the lightly-salted variety is lower carb, though.

**Caution**: I'm 6'2"" and currently work out 6 times a week so my list is pretty heavy on protein. If you're 5'2"" and sedentary, eating an entire Quest pizza may totally wreck your macros, so treat this as a ""sometimes"" / ""partial-portion"" list!

Background: I've lurked for a long time in this sub; my kinda typical story: I went from 13 years pre-diabetic with high (drug-controlled) cholesterol to normal range blood sugar and normal cholesterol without drugs thanks to my second run with keto over the last year or so. I lost a few pounds too, although the real motivation is that I was textbook normal-weight-range but with crap blood chemistry and family history of The 'Betus.

This is just some recent stuff I've been using to get by on keto (or occasionally stretches of modified-atkins) while not actively trying to drop weight. Yes, it's always better to prepare your own stuff - especially early on, or if you have portion control issues with keeping snacks around the house. But life happens, roadtrips and vacations come up, etc. So I made this as a braindump for a coworker but figured y'all may find it helpful.

&#x200B;

There's plenty more foods I rely on that are probably more mainstream keto standard so I omitted most of those (lite salt, quest bars, shirataki noodles, etc. etc.) since they've been pretty well covered here.",1

Words cannot quantify how huge this is for me.  Back in August before I knew about Keto I worked my ass off for a month, 5 days a week, counted calories and dealt with feeling a constant starving sensation.  I dropped to 259.3  

I get the importance of Non Scale Victories and all that... but JESUS FUCKING CHRIST there is no sensation like looking at that scale and double checking, triple checking, sextupple checking, and it being the same every time and knowing ""JESUS FUCKING CHRIST I HAVE DROPPED 13 LBS in just 2 weeks""  When I was trying other methods, 5 pounds a month seemed insurmountable.  And not only that, those two weeks involved Christmas dinner (where I tried hard not to cheat), a welcome home dinner for a good friend visiting out of town (where I ate some cake for another friend who graduated from IU), as well as to many chips and guac and damn near a bottle of wine), a insane night out on New Years Eve, and a great night out with friends last night.

And I'm 7 pounds lighter than I've been in two years.  At this rate, I could weigh less than I did my senior year of high school (7 years ago) by Summer.  

It's so worth it.  So fucking worth it to see that scale number go lower and lower every morning.  I love bread, I love that crunch, the texture, I love the TASTE.  I love beer.

During those years, I had always (except for the very end of course) viewed my vegetarian diet as the next step towards veganism. I eventually gave up for a few reasons:

1. As the years went on, I started missing meat-eating despite being disgusted by the sight of meat when I started my vegetarian diet. I love cooking and food, so it started bothering me that I was missing out on flavorful dishes and recipes simply because of my diet restrictions.
2. I often didn't feel ""satisfied"" by my meals, even though I felt full most of the time. It's hard to describe the feeling, almost like you're hungry without being hungry. My best guess is maybe the meals I was having just didn't enough fat in them, but I'm unsure about this because some of the meals I made were high in fat.
3. I have a high metabolism, and it's hard enough to have enough food on hand to make me feel full, let alone with added diet restrictions.

Here is what my diet looks like currently: oatmeal for breakfast, beans and rice for lunch, and for dinner some sort of non-red meat based dish: salmon, chicken carnitas, etc. Breakfast and lunch are *almost* vegan (I add honey to the oatmeal and butter to the beans and rice), and I would like to adjust my dinners to have animal products only for 0 to 3 days per week max. In my experience, vegan recipes can be time consuming, due to plenty of prep work and a lot of ""saute this for 20 minutes in pan 1, and meanwhile mix these six ingredients in a bowl and cook them over medium heat in pan 2. Then, add everything to pan 1 and add liquid and simmer for 30 minutes. And then ...etc."" In other words, many of these recipes feel complicated, and they almost never fill me up, or there's no leftovers so I have to cook again the next evening. Compare that with preheating an oven, seasoning a filet of salmon, and baking it for 15 minutes, which lasts me three nights of food.

*So, here's what I need help with*: I'm looking for simple meals (think ""beans and rice"" simple) that I can cook in portions large enough to last me three or four days. I'm also a long-distance runner, so it's important that I get enough calories and enough food to help me stay full.

Thanks for any help in advance; this is something I've wanted to implement for a long time, but I've struggled so much with trying to shift my dinners to plant-based, so I'm grateful for any help I can get. :)",0

It just kind of dawned on me how much using keto vs the SAD is like using clean energy sources for the environment vs non clean sources.  If you use clean energy sources like wind and water and sunlight then your impact on the environment isnt as bad.  Just like how you can use keto to lessen the impact of food on your body.  Even in some cases it promotes healthy things for your body just like clean fuel does for the environment.

On the other hand non clean fuel sources still gets the job done.  Factories that pour chemicals into the environment to make things for us to buy cheaply is like how people stop at fast food places to refuel which gets the job done but only in the very short term.  The long term repercussions of those choices we will have to pay later(in ozone depletion and gaining fat/getting sicker respectively). 

Im not sure why this realization amazes me so much.  Just the fact that this fight of using a clean source of energy that requires more effort but is better in the long run vs cheap, quick, and dirty energy its not just a personal struggle.  Its a global one that affects everyone.

My wife and I both have plenty of weight to lose and Keto and OMAD is definitely doing the trick on weight loss, but for many reasons we don’t want to eat this way for forever. Like I said, I don’t really need the arguments why I should just keep eating this way. I get it, I’ve read it, been lurking on Keto for a while, but it’s not how I’d like to live my life in the long run. 
However, it is very useful for weight loss and it is helping us reevaluate our relationship with food. So, we both feel confident that we can be better about junk and portions and all those things when we’ve reached goal weight. And we’re consciously building a much more active lifestyle too. We’re all in on bettering our bodies in a holistic way. And Keto is making us lose super fast, so that’s motivating. 

My question is this: I see people talk about switching to maintenance and I wonder how many have switched out of Keto to more just whole, real food diet and maintained? My ideal would be to eat small portions of meat, lots of veg, not have to worry about fruit intake, some grains, but not a lot. And then have occasional treat or less healthy meal, but keep it very occasional. Like, we have cake for birthdays, real cake and I just don’t really worry about that slice I eat. I want to be at a place where that stuff isn’t a big deal because it’s literally a once in a while thing, and mostly I just eat real foods. I don’t want a SAD diet, I want something in the paleo range I guess? I don’t need bread, I enjoy fat, I’m not crazy about how much meat I eat right now for many reasons. I don’t really need a lecture, I just want to know if I’m being super unrealistic. Will I gain it all back with an active lifestyle and a diet of fruit, nuts, veg, meat and an occasional grain? ",1

Nutrion Professor Says I'm Missing Nutrients,12,j9ziie,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/j9ziie/nutrion_professor_says_im_missing_nutrients/,24,1602565359.0,"My husband and I recently transitioned to the plant based diet several months ago, so we're relatively new at this. Although we've been thinking about it for a while (since Forks Over Knives came out). But the decision was finally made when my husband (who became a telemetry nurse at the beginning of the year) saw the detrimental effects of a meat-rich diet in his patients first hand (diabetes, heart conditions, etc.).

&#x200B;

Anyway, I'm taking some prereqs classes to prep for going into nursing school myself. One of the prereqs happen to be human nutrition, which I was excited about after watching so many documentaries on differnt types of diet and reading a lot of articles on the internet. In my dietary analysis assignment, I stated that we've become plant based and stopped buying animal products from the grocery store. My professor commented on my assignment saying, 

>""Don't do that because you think it is healthier...it is not.  A lot of nutrients missing in a plant based diet that you get from animal products...fyi.""

&#x200B;

It's a little frustrating to see her comment because obviously there is a whole population of people thriving on the plant-based diet. And throughout our class I didn't see any nutrient that can't be found in the plant kingdom (except for B12, of course).  Besides, my dietary analysis report says I'm getting enough nutrients from my food except for Vit D, which I think I'm getting enough through sun exposure (jogging outside 2-3 times a week) and low dose supplements.

So I'm wondering if I'm missing something here? Why is there such a disconnect between these professors/experts (and I do respect her credentials, she has been working in the nutrition field for a long time) and others who advocate for plant-based diet? And most importantly, which heckin' nutrient did she think I was missing?",0

Critics of that position will say that coconut saturated fat is medium chain which is different from the longer even more harmful fats found in animals and that the medium chain fats combined with the vitamins combined with the oleic acid means our bodies process coconut fat differently and therefore we shouldn't worry about it. 

Critics of THAT viewpoint will point to the fact that coconut oil studies are quite often funded by the meat and dairy industry using similar tactics to the recent egg study, where they will test the results only against other animal product consuming people and not against abstainers, meaning they are searching for a result rather than truly testing the effect. 

If I'm otherwise in ok health is coconut oil an always avoid food or can I eat WFPB for most of the month and then have a slice of no bake cheesecake or a nut cheese solidified with coconut oil once or twice a month? 

I'm also trying to understand the point at which moderation really means moderation. When does consuming oil negate the health effects of eating WFPB... once a year? Once a month? Once a week?

I'm a member of another 2 keto groups, but I am sure there are those of you who first find this group, as I did.  I had no idea that there were women's groups for another 6 months or so.

I'm 58 years old.  I've had a lot of success with keto - I began at 190 lbs (13.57 stone), and am currently 123 lbs (8.79 stone).  I gained confidence and ended anxiety.  After a year I went off because my cholesterol was through the roof, but I got it down, so am starting keto again focusing on healthy fats.  I originally was able to get down to about 132, but bounced to 138 over the year (mostly water) and after beginning again on March 20th, am down to 123+.  I've never weighed below 145 as an adult.  I'm having a blast at thrift and consignment stores, as I've found that many of the smaller sizes tend to be new/almost new.  I've been doing IF and OMAD on Saturdays, just since beginning this time, as I had been stuck at 132 for a while the last time.  I'm trying to lose just a bit more fat, and trying to get autophagy with IF/OMAD to take care of my wrinkly stomach and the fat on the back of my thighs.  We'll see.  I've also been using resistance bands, which have helped my waist a lot.  

I'm most looking forward to my daughter's college graduation.  At my son's graduation, I looked like his grandmother.  I'm looking pretty good now, and wrinkly or not, I'll be glad to look at those photos and to not feel shame (I know that my son does not feel this - just me!) Most of the photos are from behind, because that is where I've always packed a lot of weight, and the bottom photos are of my ""start"" and what I'm looking like now:  [KetoJourney](https://i.imgur.com/bPgsxKy.jpg)",1

For people over the age of 60, Malhotra said, ""LDL cholesterol is not associated with cardiovascular disease and is inversely associated with all cause mortality."" He added that the No. 1 risk factor for heart attacks is ""insulin resistance, driven by a number of dietary factors especially increased sugar and other refined carbohydrates.""

In other words, it's not the meat, which contains less than 10% saturated fat, in your burger that's the problem, noted Malhotra. It's the bun, the French fries and the sugary drink that washes it all down, he said.

Not that he condones eating excessive amounts of red meat, which may be a separate issue, he said. The main culprit, though, is industrial processing of food.

""The processed foods that people perceive to be high in saturated fats are in fact loaded with sugar, other refined carbohydrates and industrial seed oils (commonly known as vegetable oils) which are also now implicated in being pro-inflammatory and linked to heart disease, cancer and dementia,"" Malhotra said. And so, he recommends eating real food as opposed to processed.

On Keto for three days; not sure I'm doing it right.,1,stuyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/stuyj/on_keto_for_three_days_not_sure_im_doing_it_right/,10,1335490835.0,"Hi all,

Just a quick question:

I started a Keto diet on Tuesday and have been completely faithful to it since. I've counted my calories, made sure my carb intake is always under 22 grams per day and have been eating eggs, meat and green vegetables with every meal.

Thing is, I don't feel any different. No signs of flu yet and (without wanting to jynx anything) it doesn't feel hard to stick to at all. I get to eat delicious foods which I already loved and actually feel LESS hungry on it than when I was binging on carbs.

So I guess my question is: beyond buying a test are there any signs I should be looking for that I'm doing this right? It doesn't feel difficult enough and my body doesn't seem to be complaining all that much - I'm worried that I'm screwing up somewhere.

Thanks in advance,",1

One Year Anniversary - 131 lbs Down!,1666,8ujbmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/8ujbmh/one_year_anniversary_131_lbs_down/,120,1530220672.0,"**For those that just want to see pictures:** [https://imgur.com/a/XyOKLKS](https://imgur.com/a/XyOKLKS)
 
 
So it's almost been a year since I decided to take control of my health that was spiraling out of control. July 2, 2017 I stumbled upon intermittent fasting and kicked off my health phase by jumping directly into OMAD (one meal a day). As I kept learning of the next week, I found out that keto paired extremely well with it and I launched a lazyish keto at the start.
 
Over time, I got strict on keto and kept under 20g of net carbs (usually around 10-15g) and I watched as the weight came off much faster than I expected. I had a ton of energy and started to workout, still a bit inconsistent as I'll go 2-3 weeks with no workouts and then start back up again for a month or so. During the holidays (December 2017), I did go off keto to enjoy the food and it did set my back by quite a bit as I gained a lot of water weight and fat as I ate way too much food. In the end, keto and IF was 99% of the equation for me for my progress. I logged, and continue to log, all my food in MFP and track my weight to see overall trends. 
 
**TL;DR:  Keto and OMAD were the primary tools used; working out didn't change much in overall weight loss**
 
 
**Stats:**

* Male, 35 years old, 5'9""
* Starting Weight: 296.6 lbs
* End Weight (one year): 165.2 lbs
* Current Status:  Starting to find maintenance calories
* Starting Jean Size: Men's 46
* Current Jean Size:  Men's 32
* Starting Shirt Size: XXXL
* Current Shirt Size: Medium

 
**Cons of weight loss**
So I feel I should mention there have been some downsides that I'm having to adjust to. First, all the new clothes I've had to buy. Thankfully there is a nice thrift store that I have been buying second  hand clothes from to save money. Finally, yes, I do have loose skin on my abdomen. Standing up it hides pretty well as a little front pouch, but when I bend over, well......it's not pretty. I'm hoping over time it will tighten up some, but I've come to realize I won't have that 6 pack unless I want surgery.

**Overall**
For those that are just starting your journey, or those that are already on it, stick with it. Yes there are ups and downs throughout the entire time, but in the end, it's worth it. Seeing posts helped me and I hope my post can do the same to show that you CAN make a difference in your life and improve yourself.",1
One Year Anniversary: 402>228 [Pics],1734,9gtzg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9gtzg3/one_year_anniversary_402228_pics/,196,1537298980.0,"So, I lost a lot of weight this year.  Gaining weight is one of those things that happens slowly... then all at once.  I've been obese since as long as I can remember.  You know you're fat, but it doesn't hit you until you can't do normal things anymore.  First you can't keep up with your friends on vacation, then you can't buckle your seat belt on a plane, and then you can't even fit into a booth at a restaurant.  

I lurked here on r/keto for close to a year.  I was obviously particularly interested in the other posts of people > 400lbs.  I just didn't know if I could do it.  I had lost weight before (20lbs here, 40lbs there), but nothing ever stuck for more than a couple of months.  Last September, I decided enough was enough, and I launched head-first into keto.  And it was extraordinarily difficult.  I was hungry, and I wanted to eat something sweet.  Sugar addiction was very real.  What truly kept me going was visiting this subreddit everyday and seeing other people's progress pictures.  I wanted to look like that, I wanted to be below 200lbs for the first time in my adult life.   

I've stuck to keto pretty religiously, but that's not to say I haven't continued to struggle with overeating on occasion.  I just ensure that it's not with carbs/sugars, but with healthy keto food.  I could give a tons of tips/tricks, but the best one is put saftey rails in your life that facilitate smart decision making.  When you're tired, of course you're not going to make dinner, so it's better to prep all of your meals ahead of time.  Make sure you have decent snacks in the house (cheese has been my life saver!).  Once I realized that I was poor at making real-time decisions, it became easier to plan ahead for possible eventualities that might derail me. 

I want to truly thank everyone here in the r/keto community. You've all been a tremendous inspiration to me throughout the past year.

I don't have much to add that I haven't already said in one of the above posts...I'm getting carded again.  Before I lost the weight, I think I had been carded once in the previous year.  Now that I've lost weight, I've been carded every time I've gone out for a drink (not that I think I look that young, but apparently I look younger).  Most of my ""small"" clothes that I had saved in the attic are too big.  I had to go out and buy ""new"" even smaller clothes.

Overall, starting and sticking to Keto has been one of the best, possibly the best, decision I've ever made.  When I started, my big goal was under 160lbs.  Ha!  Here I am sitting between 130-135lbs.  I didn't just crush my goal, I completely annihilated it.

[WHOLE YEAR PROGRESS](https://i.imgur.com/u5CU4dy.jpg)  

Now the non-picture boring stuff:

Overall headline: Focus on diet and not exercise at first. I didn't start exercising until I was probably 3 months or so in, starting really small with snails-pace running once a week. I couldn't run more than a minute or so without stopping when I started. Now I have a set of Olympic Rings, pull-up accessories, a bunch of free weights, my best 5k time (~28 minutes) and a half-marathon in the rear-view.  

Here is my Keto timeline:  
**Month -1:** I read about Keto a lot, including Gary Taubes anti-sugar books. I thought Atkins was for insane people before I heard enough of the science to realize it isn't *all* wackadoo.  
**Month 1:** I ate according to the r/keto 1-week-meal plan.  
**Month 2-3:** I focused on macros only and went for walks during my lunch hour.  
**Month 3:** I continued watching macros but added some light running and pull-up 'attempts', my first exercise in years.  
**Month 4-9:** I only closely watched my carb intake but I had a general awareness of total calorie consumption. I started running one or two 5ks a week. I got a gym membership and went about once a week for weight-lifting and cardio (in the winter).  
**Month 10-12:** I started an even lazier form of keto where I was only generally aware of carb intake. I added cheat days to my diet to enjoy some carbs*. I balanced those out with two fasting days during the week (Monday and Wednesday) where I consumed only ~600 calories in the mornings and water-fasted the rest of the day. I generally upped each exercise I enjoyed and discarded those I didn't. I read a lot about body-weight fitness and cancelled my gym membership to run outside in the nice weather. 
  
*Weird tip: Whenever a craved a specific food, I added it to a list on my phone. I called it my food bucket list -- all of the stuff I could eat once my body was where I wanted it to be. I slowly realized the list wasn't as exciting as I once thought it was. I still followed through on the bucket list promise though. I started adding cheat days/weekends to consume those things again. None of them were as good as I remembered (except cereal with milk). I'm finally through the list and ready to restrict myself again, knowing those foods don't own me.
  
Lastly and most importantly, I've learned what works for me are more binary restrictions and controls (or close to binary). Fasting for a day or cutting out an entire group of food is way easier for me than casual moderation. I cheat with most forms of moderation. With these restrictions I can make goals, check statuses, and point to the exact failures. I've been able to then loop back in exceptions and psuedo-moderation with that general binary framework in place. It has worked so far for me, and I hope it continues.

Anyway, I hope that might be helpful for someone. Cheers and thanks for the year of control!",1
One Year Update (NSFW Pics),1915,a3eja2,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/a3eja2/one_year_update_nsfw_pics/,291,1544060233.0," *I’ve been writing this post for a few days, trying to figure out exactly what I want to say. I’m still not sure, so if it sounds like I’m rambling, it’s because I am. Several days of thoughts combined in to one post. Sorry.* 

&#x200B;

Yesterday was my one-year anniversary of starting keto (this time around). It’s the longest that I’ve ever stuck with a diet and I’ve seen amazing results. Consider this a shout out to everyone on this subreddit for being an amazing support group. I try to be active and offer support when I can, but I never really know what to say. 

&#x200B;

It’s been 365 days since I’ve gone a day with more than 15g of carbs. Here is what I’ve learned and some advice that I want to give to anyone who is just starting. Please keep in mind this is only what has worked for me. 

&#x200B;

1. **Don’t cheat**. Looking back, this is what has killed every diet that I have ever been on without question. One cookie, one piece of pizza, one whatever. That builds up and ruined my resistance because junk food is addicting. Now, I get sick if I eat too much sugar or carbs. 

&#x200B;

2. **Pictures**. This is the absolute most important thing for me. I took starting pictures of myself and then some more randomly throughout the year, and again yesterday. Seeing what I used to look like versus what I look like now is the single most motivating thing I could imagine. I’ve conditioned myself that when I get depressed over a stall or feel like I can’t continue the diet, I open those pictures to and compare them. It gives me an amazing renewed sense of purpose.

&#x200B;

3. **Self-image**. I have the most warped version of body dysmorphia anyone could be cursed with. At my highest weight, I could look at myself and think “Yeah, I’m overweight, but it’s okay. I’m not that bad.” Now, I can barely look in the mirror without being disgusted at myself. Yes, I still have weight to lose, but the difference is insane. I should be proud of myself. If it wasn’t for friends and family telling me how much better I look, I probably would’ve quit again. 

&#x200B;

4. **Scales**. I hate scales. They never give good news. I made the mistake of creating a habit of weighing myself every morning before I go to work. Don’t do this, your weight changes too much. Once a week is fine and probably better for your sanity. 

&#x200B;

5. **Help**. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Whether it’s friends, family, or me. I will offer any advice that I can. I will listen to you if you are frustrated and need to vent. Weight loss is an intense and stressful journey that you may not be able to handle by yourself. Don’t let it frustrate you in to stopping before you meet your goals. If you say you have no one to talk to, you’re wrong. You have me. 

&#x200B;

Now that I’ve made you all suffer through that, I’ll tell you what you want to know:

*For reference: I am 6’5” tall, 32 years old, and male.* 

12/4/17: 501.00 pounds  
12/4/18: 310.80 pounds

12/4/17: 69” waist  
12/4/18: 54” waist

12/4/18: 52” chest

12/4/17: 20” neck  
12/4/18: 17” neck

This weekend I hit a large goal in the actual numbers of weight loss. I leave for a trip to Iceland with high school friends next week, and I wanted to hit 100lbs lost before I did that. While social media posts are obviously not the most important part of this journey, I finally felt compelled to share the past year. Below is the post I made on my personal accounts. I make no mention of keto because that is a mixed bag, but really its not the most important part anyway. Either way, I'm just so happy to have changed my life.

A year ago, I was a 23 year old with chronic back pain, persistent arthritis in my knees, overwhelming amounts of anxiety, and a digestive system that wanted to see me die. It was right around this time last year when I decided I was tired of those things.

In one night I decided to overhaul my entire life. I’m forever thankful that I did because I cannot imagine spending another full year the way that I felt.

I find it incredibly important to note that I did not start on this journey looking for any change to my physical appearance or for a drop in the scale. I have been fat for over 15 years. I am still fat. I don’t like the narrative of “I was so depressed and mad at how I looked so I changed it.” Please love your bodies at WHATEVER stage your body is in. Have I ever been the picture of health? Definitely not. Does that mean I shouldn’t love my body? Definitely not. I changed my life BECAUSE I loved my body where I was, and I wanted to treat it better.

This has been a pretty monumental year for me in personal growth (and shrinkage). The scale has now dropped 100lbs, and I love my body no more or no less than I did 100 lbs ago. However, because of the changes I think my body will last me a little longer.

I had two pretty eye opening experiences this weekend. I found my senior prom dress, and tried it on. I laced it up as tight as the dress allows, but still if I let go of the sides it fell off of me. Also, I found a Hogwarts shirt at Walmart. Shirts like these are not often made in larger plus sizes, or their prices are astronomical. This weekend though, I got to buy a Hogwarts shirt that fits.

P.S. I don’t think I’ve had a haircut in the past year, so there’s some nice growth too lol.

I never in my life before would have ever worn a basketball jersey without a t shirt under it, and shorts were my enemy because I hated my thighs and legs. I never knew I had great calves under everything.

Anyway, thankful to finding this reddit and all the success stories that kept, and keep me going. I am happy to answer of of your questions.

There was no lazy keto for me. I run, shoot hoops, lift weights and eat clean. Veggie smoothies  I do have a cheat week (7-10 days) where I eat whatever I want about every 3-4 months. Other than that my discipline, focus, testosterone, sexual performance, just everything has improved tremendously. Would not happen without keto. 

Before I was like so many people, hitting that gym 4 days a week and eating Wendy's wondering if I just need to run longer. I wish I had known about this is college or my 20s.

A few unsolicited words of advice:

* The only thing being “cheated” by going over your carb limit or eating “cheat” meals is yourself. If you’re looking to this way of eating as a means to lose weight, please do not plan “cheat” meals. Is it going to be the end of the world if you go over every now and then? Of course not. But every day of progress is precious. Don’t waste them for temporary gratification.
* Track religiously, especially in the beginning. You will learn so much from tracking about the food you eat, portions, etc. and it’s also critical in the beginning for avoiding “carb creep.”
* Electrolyte balance is pivotal.
* Remember - carbs are a hard limit; protein is a goal; fat is a soft limit and should be eaten only to satiety. If you are eating this way for weight/fat loss, there is little to be gained from incorporating extra dietary fat in the way of “fat bombs,” bullet-proof coffee, etc. Eat enough fat within your meals to keep yourself satiated, and let your body fat fuel the rest.

Now for the life story.

I have always struggled with my weight. As a kid, I was active and involved in sports, organized and otherwise. I didn’t eat excessively, or eat what I considered at the time to be extraordinarily unhealthy. Still, to put it bluntly, I was the fat kid in class through middle school, high school, college, and law school. Year after year, I kept gaining weight. After more than 15 years of continuous weight gain, I was approaching 400 pounds.

Toward the end of 2017, I started looking into options for losing weight. I’ve gone to the gym on and off over the years, tried various diets (low-fat/lean protein diets, WW, Atkins, South Beach, etc.) and here and there enjoyed some limited success. I would lose 15-20 pounds over the space of 3-4 months; but, inevitably, I would relax my standards and the weight always came back with a vengeance. I also explored the possibility of medical intervention, but decided it just wasn’t the right path for me. I knew that if I was serious about losing the weight and keeping it off, I needed to find a dietary solution that I could stick to permanently.

After a lot of research, I landed on the ketogenic diet. I mentioned that I have done various trendy diets before, with success, but I was never that strict and never had a great plan in place for the long-term. There was something about the rigidity of keto that really appealed to me. It had a simple set of rules that I thought I could adhere to over the long haul, and its proponents promised that if you followed the rules you would get results. Not to mention, you could eat enough bacon and eggs to make Ron Swanson proud. Cool.

So on January 15, 2018, I dove in head first. I tossed all the sugary, starchy, and processed foods that I was used to eating and decided that from then on I would consume fewer than 20g of carbohydrates a day; I would track my calories and aim for a lofty deficit; I would eat enough protein to maintain lean muscle mass, and eat dietary fat to satiety; and, most importantly, I would never cheat. My diet would consist of meat, green vegetables, eggs, nuts/seeds, and a moderate amount of dairy. On that day I weighed 387.8 pounds. Since January 15, 2018, I have lost nearly 140 pounds and cut about 16 inches from my waist. Today I weigh 248.8 pounds. I’ve decided to upload pictures of my progress and a chart showing the long bumpy road to get here.

Partially as a result of keto, I also quit drinking alcohol. Obviously, committing to keto meant I had to give up beer- a tall task considering I used to be a home-brewer and have loved the craft beer world since before I was of legal age. But, praise be to Jack Daniels, low and behold, whiskey has no carbs! So I started drinking whiskey-diet cokes whenever I would venture out to the bars. I quickly discovered that when you don’t have a solid base of bread and pasta in your gut, liquor hits you like a ton of bricks. Two drinks and I’d be quite drunk; more than that and I would be hungover for a day and a half. It wasn’t worth it, so I decided to quit drinking altogether.

I quit drinking alcohol on February 5, 2018, which has been nothing but a positive change for me. In a couple of weeks I will celebrate one full year of sobriety.

Sobriety and weight loss have brought about a host of other benefits. To name a few: brain fog gone; energy way up; no more back and foot pain; better sleep; no more snoring; no ravenous hunger; and a sort of mental clarity and sense of contentment that I have never experienced before in my life.

I have a lot more work to do. But I am incredibly proud of my progress so far.

If I can say one more thing, it is TALK ABOUT KETO. Please talk about keto. Talking about keto has been so important for me. I know the first rule around here is basically keep it secret, keep it safe. Trust me, I get it. Not everyone will understand and some people will react negatively. But I really think you should talk about keto with your friends, your family, your co-workers, and really anyone who is interested. Don’t preach. Don’t force it on anyone. But, if someone is curious, why not share your successes with them, inform them about the benefits of this way of eating (and the compromises you have to make to obtain them), and try your best to make sure your people know that what you are doing is entirely healthy and safe, and the right choice for you. I think you will find, more often than not, that people are going to be in your corner.

Besides, you always have the good people here to fall back on. I am really fortunate to have an amazing group of supportive friends, family and co-workers who have encouraged me along the way. But,without this sub I don’t know where I would be. Thank you to all you wonderful people in this community. KCKO!

EDIT:  Wow! I am incredibly touched and humbled by all of your wonderful responses. Thank you so much for all of the encouragement! And gold! Seriously?! Thank you so much!",1

I had also been struggling with IBS for over 15 years and was borderline high BP and diabetic. I have two boys who were 3 and 8 months when I decided to give Keto a try for health reasons in addition to weightloss. 

Just a year later and I’m “normal” weight range for the first time since I was about 14 years old. My IBS is almost entirely resolved (still some issues related to gallbladder removal). Last month I reapplied for life insurance and qualified for top tier. I’m in perfect health! I’m 6 weeks out from running my first half-marathon. I quit my day job and make a living weightloss coaching people with my program and website. Can’t wait to see what the next year brings!

One year of Keto today!

For the most part, I've kept pretty quiet about it online. Today happens to be my 1 year anniversary of following the Keto way of eating.

**45/M/5'10"" | SW: 230? | CW: 185 | GW: 165**

Here's some of my experiences:

• I've lost around 45 pounds so far with no exercise. I didn't weigh myself at the start, so I have to estimate. Photo: [https://i.imgur.com/TvB7Nwt.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/TvB7Nwt.jpg)

• Most of the information on nutrition from textbooks, associations, doctors, etc. isn't just wrong, it's doing major damage to our health. There's a reason we're collectively getting fatter and sicker and it's not that we used to be more active or that somehow our genes have become defective in one or two generations. If you have Amazon Prime, watch ""Fat: A Documentary"" and start unlearning and relearning.

• Type 2 Diabetes can be put into complete remission. I hadn't been to the doctor in a while, but I have no doubt I was at least pre-diabetic, based on some symptoms I was experiencing. 1 in 10 Americans has diabetes. At the current rate, that will be 1 in 3 by 2050. My HbA1c is currently 4.8.

• What I used to call being hungry was actually just cravings. When you eat foods that trigger satiety, you learn the difference. When you experience satiety, the binging behaviors go away.

• When your blood sugar is stable, you can go without eating. Intermittent fasting becomes really easy. Breakfast is not the most important meal of the day - that's just marketing, skip it. If you're not hungry, don't eat.

• Now that I'm not inflamed all the time, I just feel better. When chronic inflammation is your reality, you don't realize that it's not normal to be achy all the time. I was experiencing random muscle and bone pain (fibromyalgia?). I would randomly feel like I had pulled a muscle in my leg one day and it would be gone the next. My arm would feel like my bone was aching. Haven't had that at all over the last 12 months.

• My seasonal allergies were significantly better this year - probably again because I'm not in a perpetual state of inflammation.

• My skin is better. No more boils, no more hidradenitis suppurativa.

• 18 months ago I was on the verge of going to the doctor to get tested for chronic fatigue syndrome. I was having episodes every two weeks where I would have this debilitating brain fog. I couldn't focus on anything, I couldn't get anything done, and I would drive to work in the morning feeling so exhausted that I would question whether or not I should really be driving. That is all gone.

• My mental health has improved. My mood is much more stable, I'm less irritable.

With a list like that, it sounds like I'm selling some sort of snake oil, but it's 100% true. There's no program to subscribe to, no products to buy, no pills to take. In fact, if you see something at the grocery store with ""keto"" on the label, you'd probably be better avoiding it. All you need is real food, preferably with one ingredient. Can't go wrong with eggs, ribeye, butter, and broccoli.

Seeing all of the progress posts on here all year long has definitely kept me motivated, so I felt like I should contribute my own story.",1
One year on keto. Hit my goal weight!!,1938,ekcgac,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/ekcgac/one_year_on_keto_hit_my_goal_weight/,106,1578256305.0,"[https://imgur.com/a/aJoymCG](https://imgur.com/a/aJoymCG)

  

I’ve struggled with my weight my entire life. The first time I remember it ever being an issue though, was in the 3rd grade when a substitute teacher had the entire class weigh themselves and write the numbers up on the chalkboard, and me being the first name on the list with the highest weight (a piss poor way to teach children how to calculate averages, medians, etc, in my opinion… but, it is what it is) In the 7th grade, I remember a classmate asking me “what are you down to now, 240 pounds?” before mooing at me and slamming my hand in my locker door. That struck me hard, the irony being that I had been doing the military diet at the time, and that actually was what I was down to.

In high school, I developed a severe case of anorexia, and became addicted to going to the gym. I ate only an apple a day and worked out for 3 hours every single day for about a year. I lost 140 pounds in that time, but, I also lost most of my hair, stopped having my monthly cycle and was being turned in to my guidance counselor at school regularly. I didn’t care, I thought I looked good (for the record, I did not. My senior pictures are scary to look at now) That all changed though, the first time I “allowed” myself to eat a cheeseburger. McDonalds may very well have saved my life, but, unfortunately that got me started mindlessly bingeing food, and by the time I graduated, I had put on so much weight that I had to walk across the stage to accept my diploma with my gown completely open, because I was barely able to get it around me, let alone get it buttoned up.

That was 20 years ago. Since then, my weight has gone up and down through fad diets, pregnancy, every eating disorder imaginable, moves, marriage, divorce, and all the other things life threw at me. I hit my highest weight of 335 in 2017, and that was when I decided enough was enough, and I went on a diet program that I had seen on TV years and years ago, and had had some success with in the past (I literally ate nothing but lettuce and canned tuna, baked chicken and steamed vegetables with no salt, no, butter, nothing) I did manage to lose about 50 pounds doing that, but, I basically hated my life, and eating this way got my eating disorders going again and spiraling out of control. 

I started Keto on December 26th 2018 after a close friend made me realize that what I was doing to myself was not healthy. It finally sunk in that I didnt want to live this way anymore. I weighed 280 pounds. On December 29th, almost exactly one year later, I hit my goal weight of 160. I’m still on keto, and I plan to stay on keto forever. I don’t ever want to go back to where I was. But now, I’m more relaxed about my calories, and am focusing on building strength. 

I’d love to be able to say that the last year was perfect. That I never ever went over on my carbs or calories. That I always hit my protein macro. That I drank a gallon of water every single day, and never missed a workout. But, I can’t. I’ve slipped. I’ve gotten lazy. I’ve made mistakes. But, keto has taught me to be mindful of what I put into my body, and how I treat myself. Even more than just aesthetics, I like feeling healthy and strong. I like that I love myself enough to take care of my body and my mind. I’m learning that I’m not perfect, and its ok. So now, when I have a bad day, or two, or three…I don’t rip myself apart. I don’t view myself as a failure. I just dust myself off and keep moving forward. 

So, to everyone in the keto community, thank you so much for all of your guidance. Your posts and stories have kept me going. And now I hope I can inspire others the way you all have inspired me. And to anyone just starting out, or thinking about starting, I know sometimes it can feel daunting. Its easy to get discouraged when you don’t lose 5 pounds every single week. Or when you go for 2 or 3 or 4 weeks and the scale doesn’t budge. Its normal. Its ok! Just keep going. Time really does move a lot faster than you think. A year from now, you’ll be glad you started today.

Onions and Shallots,2,jgaxpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jgaxpm/onions_and_shallots/,4,1603437059.0,"Horns Up!

I was watching a Headbangers Kitchen video, and he had a guest cook on that recommended people on keto use shallots instead of onions.  They give you close to the same flavor, but are much lower in carbs.

I'm in the US.  I wen to the USDA website, and looked up shallots.  According to the USDA, shallots have 16.8 g of carbs/100g and 3.2g of fiber/100g.  A yellow onion has 9.34g of carbs/100g and 1.7g of fiber per 100g.  The onion was clearly lower in carbs than the shallot was.

So I posted a comment the video and I got a reply that she used the UK nutrition database.  So, after much digging, I found the UK database.  According to the British, shallots have 3.3g of carbs/100g and 1.4g of carbs/100 g.  Onions have 8g of carbs/100g and 1.1g of fiber/100g.

That's a HUGE discrepancy in the shallot numbers.

So, what's a ketoer to believe?",1
Only 11 pounds down after a month of keto and 5x5. Need some advice.,0,94hbp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/94hbp3/only_11_pounds_down_after_a_month_of_keto_and_5x5/,24,1533395227.0,"Hi all,

I posted it originally at /r/ketogains but since this subreddit has way more people, someone might be able to help me. 

So I'm 29/M/6' starting weight was 286 lb now I'm at 275 lb.

I was keto on and off but for past month I was doing everything properly, no cheating, nothing. Despite that I see almost no progress.

Keto calc gave me P:142g, F:134g, 1854 kcal for no exercise with P:0.8g/lb. For exercise days I added around 250 kcal more, hence P:141g, F:156g, 2040 kcal.

I work out in the morning, around 8 am, then I go to work and I have coffee with 4 spoons of cream and then I eat around 5 pm for around 2 hours, all my calories and the day repeats. I've been even eating the same things for past month. Which is pork, beef, chicken, cheese, coconut oil, lard, spinach etc. All cooked myself. Everyday I'm around 10g of cars mostly from veggies and some whey.

I've just measured my blood ketones, like I do every Saturday morning, and I ended up with only 0.7 mmol/L, previously it was 1.0 and earlier 1.6. It seems like I'm slowly out of ketosis somehow. Almost no change in body fat (1-2%) over that month and no visible posture changes (I take pic every week).

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but I mist admit working 5 days a week and seeing no results it's quite annoying, because I put lots of work into that. Ofc, I'm eating/drinking all electrolytes and vitamins. 

Do you think, it might be something with working out in the morning and eating in the evening? Maybe I should eat everything after working out or resign IF and eat across the day. I can work out only in the morning, so I have to adjust meals to that.

Overweight my entire life. 7 months. 235 lbs to 151 lbs. I love keto!,2608,7whw2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7whw2r/overweight_my_entire_life_7_months_235_lbs_to_151/,212,1518250700.0,"[Side by side.](https://i.imgur.com/7Tg2J4k.jpg)

[NSFW Pic.](https://imgur.com/a/P133K)

Like the title says, I have been overweight my entire life.  A little bit about me, I am 34 year old first generation Vietnamese Mechanical Engineer.  I am 5'6"" and went from 235 lbs in July of 2017 to 151 lbs in a little over 7 months.  I have been very reluctant to share my journey *anywhere* because of the possible blow back but I decided to finally share today because I feel like if I can help others through posting like so many others have done for me, then it'd be worth it.

After learning what I have and having gone through this journey, I constantly find myself looking at others making the same mistakes as me and wish I could help.  Typically, when speaking in person, it's hard to get everything you want across and even if you do, people get defensive.  So, anyway, here's the details!

One fateful day on June 30, 2017, I read an article about how Russell Wilson (Go Hawks!) got a new nutritionist after gaining weight and losing speed and stamina on the field.  Looking down that rabbit hole and after reading several books, I learned a TON about nutrition and general health that I never knew before.  Everything I thought I knew about being healthy was *wrong*.  The end product for me was a combination of the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting.  This doesn't mean that I think keto and IF are **the** answer for everyone, but they worked for me.  I am a strong believer that each individual's biology is unique and what works for one person may not work for others.

BUT, this is r/keto!   So, I'll dive into some of those details!!  

We're all well aware of what to eat on keto but here are some meals I have made over the months.  [NOMS.](https://imgur.com/gallery/caYfa)

I started IF maybe a month into going keto (it just comes so naturally!) and even have dabbled in OMAD and some extended fasts.  Both of the latter I've done to try and combat loose skin.  I lift at weekday lunches for about 45 min just because when all this fat goes, I wanna like what I see underneath.  But by no means do I contribute that to my weight loss.  It's all about diet!

Cheers and KCKO!

PS, if anyone has any questions about my diet, weight lifting, cardio (or lack thereof!), research, science, supplements, or food, PLEASE feel free to ask.  I'd love the opportunity to help people just like so many of you have helped me.",1

PSA Don't do egg fast,0,bqzos0,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/bqzos0/psa_dont_do_egg_fast/,26,1558407499.0,"TLDR: uncontrollable body fluid evacuation at work. Just don't do it, KCKO

I know, I know it's a silly fad but I've been on keto nearly a year, good progress but a few Kgs managed to creep their way back so thought I would do a 2-3 day egg fast just to blast them away, im already fat adapted and love eggs so what's the harm right?!
Day1 3 meals of boiled eggs and cheese, omlette for dinner. Felt great loads of energy

Day2 woke up to 2kg loss felt great, planned to eat the same as yesterday  Started to think I could do this once a month to keep weight down. Started to notice I was very dehydrated even after a ton of water, urine was very dark. About 4pm I'm in a meeting at work and sudden sharp stomach cramp and crazy hot flush came over me and I just knew I had to get to the bathroom.

Well needless to say it wasn't pretty, my body just purged everything as fast as it could along with insane sweating and stomach pain. I was so shakey, and all my body wanted was a banana. Luckily I have some lovely work mates who looked after me and an amazing husband who dropped everything to come pick me up.  Stomach cramps stayed for a while but after 2 bananas, lots of water and a chicken ramen felt almost back to normal.

My advice is not to bother it's too drastic and unnecessary, I can't look at an egg now without waves of nausea and I will probably have gained the weight back by tomorrow. No-one needs to go through what I went through. Back to a clean, calorie controlled keto in the morning !",1
PSA From a Starbucks barista,5269,7yeufu,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7yeufu/psa_from_a_starbucks_barista/,726,1518996076.0,"Frappuccinos CANNOT be made keto. If you swap whole milk for heavy cream and sweetener for sugar free vanilla, all you've done is consume half a cup of heavy cream and ~40g+ carbs from our emulsifying frappuccinos base, which is a thick sugary syrup. (Yesterday I clocked in and someone managed to gulp down a large frappuccino like this and tell the person at register she was on a LCHF diet and it was delicious and wanted a second. I was busy taking orders in the drive thru and couldn't help the poor woman.) ALSO please do not try to drink a grande heavy cream latte. Even a tall, has 10 oz of milk (2 oz espresso and the rest milk for 12 oz). If you would like an espresso drink, order a hot or iced americano with heavy cream, which would be espresso + water + milk, and you can add any of the sugar free syrups if you like. 

If you are unsure if we put heavy cream in your coffee (you can usually tell because heavy cream can leave small undisolved particles in your drink which go away when stirred, or if the color seems too dark) then ask us. We understand dietary restrictions and want to make sure you get what you are paying for!

Our ice coffee and ice tea come sweetened, as instructed by our recipes. Our cold brew ice coffee does not, but ask for all of these unsweetened anyways, then substitute whatever you like, out of sugar free vanilla or sugar free cinnamon dolce (mixing them together is heaven for me). Our skinny mocha sauce contains few carbs depending on the size, if it fits in your macros it can help curb a mean chocolate craving. Our hot coffee and hot tea do not come pre-sweetened and you have the same syrup options as above, or your own. These are the safest options for getting what you want, esp. a nice dark roast pour over... 🤤 anyways.. We use Kerry gold butter squares you can ask for on the side if you like as well. 

Lastly, if you have any questions AT ALL, do not be afraid to ask your register person or a barista that doesn't look too busy. We also have a designated person that can help customer needs, they can usually be found wearing a timer attached to their apron, restocking and cleaning things, if your register person is busy. Whether it's for how to order a drink, or what have you, don't be afraid! It took me at least a month to be able to remember even most of the menu, it can be daunting.  The only thing we wouldn't know, is the nutrition info for your drink, because most of these require some math. 

I know for most people Starbucks is unnessecary, but for those who regularly get their energy fix here, I thought this would help as these are some of the things I notice LCHF customers seem to have confusion with. I'm open to any questions you guys might have! KCKO!

Edit for clarification: The recipes for our ice teas and ice coffees, by default, say to add pumps of sweetener. However, they are brewed with plain tea leaves/plain coffee grinds. :)

Edit 2: it's also worth noting our egg bites have 9g carbs for bacon ones and 11g carbs for egg white ones, they have added rice starch sadly. On frappucinnos; you can ask to get your drink blended without base emulsifier, but the flavor and texture will be no where near the same and some stores will say no. On drink recommendations; everyone's taste is different so I recommend googling some Starbucks keto recipes and trying what you think might be good :)

Edit 3, the edit to end all edits: if you guys are unsure if you're drink is ok, the safest thing you can do is log it, and that goes for any food or drink you might have going past your lips. Nutrition info for half and half, 2%, most almond milks, etc. are all online, again I don't know for your specific drink, so it's safer to look it up! Second, *frappuccinos are not keto.* you can attempt at a keto ""frappuccino"" but by standards it's not a frappuccino, the baristas *can and might* say no, the consistency is not the same, and they might put in the emulsifier base anyways. Third, I'm not gonna tell you not to drink a whole cup of heavy whipping cream, I'm just warning everyone that it's not smart to drink 6, 10, 14, or 18 oz. of heavy whipping cream in one go (short, tall, grande, and Venti respectively). If you can't live without your grande heavy cream flat white then don't. Lastly, thanks for the gold!! 💕",1

Some examples of what is considered sexualizing:

* I'd hit that
* 10/10 would do
* wow you got hot
* I'll be in my bunk
* /r/gonewild 
* can you send me nudes
* I want to ___ you
* you're lucky you kept your ____


Some things that relate to physicality that are not sexualizing:

(edit: in case it wasn't clear, these things are perfectly acceptable, it's the sexualizing things that are a problem)

* I can see a big difference in your ____
* we've got similar starting stats, it's nice to see what weight loss could look like
* you've really changed the shape of your ___
* Have you been working out along with keto?
* great progress 
* have you noticed a big difference in your ____


Someone posting progress pictures is sharing their accomplishment, not asking how attractive you did/do think they are. If you would like people to respond to your progress in that way, you can always post on /r/ketogonewild or any of the other subs dedicated to that sort of interaction. 

**you can congratulate someone on their progress without commenting on how attractive you think they are/were/will become** 

Ladies - if you're concerned how your breasts will change in weight loss, it's really hard to make a guess, but asking questions on /r/xxketo and /r/abrathatfits is always a great idea for other women's experiences or expertise dealing with weight loss and changes in breast size/shape. If you'd like to ask a specific user about changes in their breast size here, do so with respect. 

If you see comments sexualizing progress pictures, or any other comment you think doesn't belong on /r/keto, **please make use of the report button** so the mods can take action. This is something that can/will result in a ban. **This rule is not up for discussion** - there are many places on reddit where that kind of comment is perfectly ok, but this is not one of them.",1

Not only does it make my tea taste a little better, but it's a great appetite suppressant. I'm in the early days of doing an OMAD diet, but I used to be a heavy snacker and Heavy Cream has helped a lot so far in stifling my voracious appetite for sweets and snacks.

I say don't listen to the purists that complain about the minuscule levels of carbs, if you eat less each day you will naturally lose weight and Heavy Cream does wonders as long as you don't go overboard. 2-3 cups max. The thing is about Keto, is that the food 'itself' does not equate to a ton of fat loss, it's the act of eating less each day that lowers insulin levels and that 'will' drastically lower your weight and improve your health overtime.

Keto is just half of the solution, and I'm personally on the Carnivore Keto side of things.",1

Then I read how it wasn't bad to have more mono and poly fats in your diet from people like Fuhrman and Harvard, and was convinced by some Harvard research that refined oils wasn't bad like some plant-based docs said.

&#x200B;

I watched some mcdougall videos where he said not to worry so much about salt. And never learned about the harms if high salt.

&#x200B;

Well as time went on my salt consumption just went up and up, and so did oil, until today where i Would say I was consuming around 5-7000 mg a day or more. I checked my blood pressure and it was a really high can't remember exactly maybe two weeks ago, then just today I checked it after the night before eating tons of salt it was now 146/89. YEAH!  Higher than my overweight father. Which according to the American heart association means I have stage two hypertension.

&#x200B;

Meaning I should be on medication. But I'm going to treat it with diet and lifestyle first.

&#x200B;

I was reading the American heart association, mayo clinic and American college of cardiology and yeah this is no joke.

&#x200B;

Before all this my thoughts were ""Meh, I'm healthy and if I stop eating salt I'll be iodine deficient anyway... and I eat healthily so who cares"" YEAH I WAS WRONG. My food is so salty that all I taste is salt I don't even taste food.

&#x200B;

Even though I watch every single nutrition facts video that he has made, I somehow missed ALLLLL the videos he has on salt and blood pressure. I just watched them, and apparently, it has been shown that high salt kills the second highest amount of people, right under not enough fruit.

&#x200B;

I have tried lowering my salt before in the past and it was an absolute fail only lasting 1 or 2 days.

&#x200B;

Now I have seen how dangerous my blood pressure is I'm committed to lowering my salt. I will also be exercising 90 minutes per day, following Greger's daily dozen to a tee, lowering salt to less than 2000mg a day, eating sea veg so I don't become iodine deficient.

&#x200B;

A FEW IMPORTANT THINGS!

&#x200B;

It's not age, I'm in my twenties, it's not because I'm fat I'm 6'3 150lbs and lean, I'm male, I don't have a history of hypertension in the family.

Heres my diet now for those curious. I don't eat many vegetables anymore or as healthy as I used to, mainly because I'm lazy. (note: like I say I used to be totally whole foods no oil but now I've strayed) I eat a lot of oil now and only eat processed sugar once every 2-3 months.

&#x200B;

Macros: Fat: 25-40% Protein 10-20% Carbs 60-80% depending, a lot more fat than is recommended here though.

&#x200B;

B: steel cut oats, banana, blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, non-ground flax seeds, OPTION 2: whole wheat bread 4 slices (260mg of salt each) 1 avocado, 2 apples, an orange, some blueberries

&#x200B;

L: A burrito from vegan restaurant with beans corn etc (High salt, high oil), OPTION 2: One can of black beans or chick peas or something (lots of salt) and loaded with hotsauce (200mg per tsp salt),

&#x200B;

D: Black bean soup (tons of salt) other random soups with a ton of salt.

&#x200B;

Snack: popcorn with canola or oilve oil poured on top, and loaded with salt probably 0.25 tsps or a little more, fruits like, apple, banana, orange, blueberry, strawberry, grapes, pieces of bread just eaten alone untoasted(salt)

&#x200B;

For the next (forever) i will commit to eating no salt, I've bought ms dash and I plan to use it, I plan to run alot, and I will check my blood pressure every day until it is 120 or lower and hope it gets back to where it was.

&#x200B;

My diet so far today: Oatmeal, 3 pieces of whole grain bread (ate before I checked my BP 260mg salt each slice), with one banana, flax, cinnamon, water, peas, corn, green and yellow beans, quinoa with ms dash not salt, avocado.

&#x200B;

So far I'm at 864mg of sodium, which is pretty good because usually, I'd probably already be at least 2500. I have also jogged today for 25-30m and plan to go again.

PSA: Stop Comparing Your Progress to the Sub's,1487,ep672l,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/ep672l/psa_stop_comparing_your_progress_to_the_subs/,203,1579141901.0,"Been getting a lot of posts on the sub lately about losing too fast or losing too slow when compared with the rest of the sub. Cut it out. Progress is progress and it's different for everyone.

You're losing a lot at the beginning because it's water weight.

You're losing at a slower rate because your calorie deficit is lower, you want faster loss you need to eat less.

NO, eating more fat won't solve the problem, eating a higher ratio of fat won't solve the problem. Hit your protein, fat is a limit not a goal.

You fluctuated up because everyone does, weigh in less often. 

And for the love of all that's good and holy, don't trivialize your own progress. A pound a week is an incredible, enviable loss rate for many people.

I’m really conflicted. I only know some information about WFPB. But my disease has gotten worse since being vegan. I eat whole foods, low oil. So I want to know if this one guy (and numerous others) is correct and backed by solid source? because I’m wondering if becoming plant based made my disease worse. Anyone have any information that backs up their claims or doesn’t back up? 
Because I don’t want to further my suffering anymore, if that’s the case. 

This guy says, 
“All the essential amino acids cannot be obtained from plants alone, they don't contain complete proteins. Even if you manage to get in all you can from plants to produce to achieve complete proteins, it takes the body a horrendous amount of effort to make them, and a long time, just like making omega 3 from 6, and the omega 6 to 3 ratio to do this would be rediculous for someone with HS to consume, with it being pro inflammatory, and a known problem of western diet even in the healthiest of people. 
Ps, Google vegans and bone density, or osteoporosis.”

A veg curious guy,
“I realize that vegans rely heavily on nuts, tofu, legumes, beans, etc for protein. As I mentioned I was vegetarian for 10 years. I was just asking how would someone who is following AIP also be Vegan? I realize they’re 2 different diets. Again I’m only asking bc I don’t know the answer. I honestly wish I could be Vegan I just don’t see how the 2 could go hand in hand? I thought about just eating tons of eggs and being vegetarian again, however I found out eggs are a trigger for me. I don’t judge other people’s diets. Whatever helps your HS and whatever makes you happy... to each her / his own.?”

Then he replies,
“I'm talking about complete proteins not being able to be obtained from plants alone, which is true, that's why, as you say,  you have to take things like b12, then comes the world of suppliments, I never take them because, one word, cofactors. I'm sorry mate, I've had this discussion a thousand times and it's scientific fact that you can't get complete proteins from plants alone, we have eaten meat for millions of years and and is part of the reason and way we got here in the first place. 
I have to agree with Some Lady here, being Vegan you have to supplement B12, it’s only found in meat & organ meat. 
I'm very selective about my reading sources and have no problem reading between the lines when it comes to that kind of thing, and the worlds workings in general. But I'm afraid the facts speak for themselves, veganism and poor bone density go hand in hand.”

Some lady add, “There’s also the Omega 3 issues, amino acids, bone density, CoQ10, & the list goes on (taking about being vegan)” and the guy agrees.

Parents of r/keto: I just want to remind you that starving your children is not keto. It's just abuse.,0,l8cp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/l8cp7/parents_of_rketo_i_just_want_to_remind_you_that/,15,1318375580.0,"Okay, so here's my little rant for the morning. One of my family members is a teacher. She teaches children who are 3-6 years old at a private school. I was recently talking to her about one of her kids and he was having some issues, so she had e-mailed his parents and suggested feeding him something other than nutritional supplements for breakfast and lunch.

What scared me about her retelling of this story was that she quoted the father's response as things that I've heard on r/keto innumerable times: ""He doesn't need breakfast. Your idea of nutrition is based on outdated ideas."" And when she suggested something like a bowl of oatmeal instead of a meal replacement bar: ""We don't like feeding him sugars.""

Okay, I am very much pro-keto but hearing some of r/keto's ""wisdom"" distorted in this way is disturbing. If you are doing keto with your whole family, please remember: Your child needs to eat. Real food. Your three year old doesn't need to worry about intermittent fasting, especially if it means they're going hungry all day. And your six year old needs to eat something that doesn't come out of a package, even if the alternative contains ""sugars"". 

You're not building character. You're just being an asshole.

So when the seats were full, either I felt really guilty because someone had to stand because of me.  Or I would stand up to open up the two seats, but because of my weight I was having back pain and even standing was an issue for me.

With eggs, since the cholesterol myth was debunked several years ago, I haven't heard of any other properly studied health concerns regarding them.

So my point is, if not for ethical reasons, why wouldn't you include fish and eggs to your diet? Especially fish and they're myriad of health benefits.

Plant Based Benefits,3,ejra08,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/ejra08/plant_based_benefits/,3,1578139003.0,"So first of all, I am not 100% plant based, I am 90%. 

Today also marks the completion of my second week mostly plant based.

I have a family and make a choice to enjoy my dinner time with them if that includes an animal based meal.

But let’s get to the benefits I’ve been noticing. Also would love to hear if anyone else experienced the same.

1) Better sleep, almost too good. I have noticed that I sleep like an absolute rock. I sleep so hard that I have been having trouble getting up with my alarms. When I was eating animal based every day, I would have broken up sleep. I would wake up every 3 hours it seemed. 

2) Conversation focus. I have noticed that when I am speaking with people, I feel this laser focus that I didn’t feel on animal based food. 

3) Workout stamina. I am a pretty high level crossfit athlete and energy in metcons is very important. I have noticed that barely ever feel tired. 

Also a workout note. In crossfit, at times you may tear your hands in a workout that contains high volume pull ups. On animal based meals, if my hands tore I could normally get back to workouts if they are bleeding a little bit. On plant based meals, my blood is flowing so much that it literally pours out of my hand and I have no choice but to stop or make a bloody mess. 


These are the most noticeable differences. If I notice anything different, I will post again. 

Thanks for reading.",0

The main issue is I’m extremely picky and as far as I know, I don’t like any vegetables aside from corn and potatoes. I didn’t grow up with parents who made them, so I never really learned how to make them taste good. 

I also have a restrictive eating disorder that I can’t get therapy for because I depend on my family financially and they refuse to take me to a therapist.

That being said I do want to give this diet a go and see if it helps me, so any advice on how to start eating vegetables and making them taste good would be highly appreciated

As I've done more research, it's become clear to me that B12 is a serious deficiency for Vegan's. I've read the starch solution and have read up on some arguments for why the PBD is the best diet for humans. However, I am very concerned with why our bodies would evolve to need vitamin B12, yet the only practical source of this vitamin is through animal products. Would this not be an argument for us truly thriving on an plant and animal based diet? 

I'm not making the argument for the ethical side of things. Instead, my frame of reference is purely on the healthiest diet for humans to follow. I can't follow why the healthiest, most natural diet possible, would ever involve the use of supplements. 60,000 years ago humans couldn't supplement nutritional deficiencies, rather, everything had to be ingested through food. 

I do believe that the amount of animal products is over-consumed in the SAD. However, could the healthiest diet be primarily be PBD with maybe, 3-4 servings of lean, grass-fed, zero-hormones and antibiotics added, meat a week? Through this diet, the majority of food would STILL be plant based, however the D12 deficiency is accounted for WITHOUT the use of supplements. 

Any discussion of this would be greatly appreciated, all in the name of better understanding of ourselves and what's best for us =)

Plant-based meal plan for gestational diabetes?,5,i87lqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/i87lqx/plantbased_meal_plan_for_gestational_diabetes/,11,1597237022.0,"This is more of a niche subject since it involves a more specific pregnancy demographic, and that makes it a little harder to find support. I figure I've eaten plant-based longer than I've been pregnant, so I'll start here!     

I am 25 weeks pregnant and was just diagnosed with gestational diabetes. My numbers were close to standard for the three-hour glucose test - two within range, one just a point out and another seven points out. So I figure I can manage this through diet. But my nurse hasn't gotten back to me about what it all means yet, so at the moment I'm terrified of food, and lost on how to proceed. I'm also anticipating they won't have specialized advice for a vegan diet, so I'm probably going to have to do a lot of legwork per usual with this lifestyle. Here's some background. 
      
I've been plant-based for over 10 years, and the latter half of those years have been focused more on whole-foods. I meal prep and prepare most of my dishes.      
     
A lot of that changed when COVID hit unexpectedly, and I had to adapt like the rest of us. With limited access to fresh foods and groceries, I relied more on delivery of packaged foods.     
      
Right as COVID hit, I also found out I was pregnant. Additionally, I had incredible nausea, and much of my standard legumes and fruits and vegetables made me ill. I also have a huge sweet tooth, and all this packaged food opportunity gave refined sugars the chance to slowly creep back into my life again.     
        
Pre-covid and pregancy, breakfast included dates and avocado. Lunch included cooked heirloom beans from a weekly one-pot, hummus and carrots, apples. Dinner was cauliflower stir fry, avocados, lentils, pea soup. Of course there was much more to these meals, but that's a snapshot of how my diet went. I also included some desserts, like a piece of candy, some coconut ice cream, mini vegan ice cream mochi. And I generally avoided bread and carbs, focusing on legumes and plant-based proteins.          
          
During covid, I turned toward foods like vegan waffles with maple syrup, packaged falafel, kale and hummus salads, tofu and coconut aminos, guacamole and rice cakes, frozen to cooked zughetti with marinara, frozen enchiladas. And then I supplemented with sugary snacks like hard candies, almond milk pudding, vegan chocolate chip cookies, ""organic"" ""fruit"" snacks, vegan chocolate bonbons, vegan chocolate in general.        
       
It still was all relatively healthy, but almost every part has sugar. Tomato sauce does, the added maple syrup, and all my additional candy snacking. Ultimately it still felt healthy but the sugar content was higher. And I wasn't eating mass amounts, but relative to my diet maybe yes.    
      
I also tracked my diet to make sure I was meeting my caloric needs.      
       
Right now, with this being so new and not knowing when the nurse and dietician will call me, I'm scared of food like I mentioned. I purged all of my candy and cookies. Not gonna lie, it was emotional! Sugar was a treat, especially a cookie I could call vegan.       
       
And here's a snapshot of my self-made  ""diabetic"" diet the past few days, without knowing what I'm supposed to do. I've subbed candy for fruit, though I'm not sure if that's ok either. Anyone have expertise with this?    
      
Breakfast       
- Oatmeal (1/2 cup oats, unsweetened cocoa powder, cinnamon, salt, tsp red wine vinegar - weird I know, but I hate artificial sweetners and had no idea what to add! It's not great, but I'm used to eating weird.)      
-1/2 avocado + 1 tbsp coconut aminos     
- Half a banana and 1 tsp of natural peanut butter     
        
Lunch      
-Falafel salad (Kale, cucumber, red bell pepper, 1 falafel ball, 2 tbsp hummus, 2 tbsp natural avocado-lemon dressing, basil)      
-1 cup heirloom Christmas Lima beans + Cholula, garlic     
-1/3 cup frozen blueberries + a couple frozen peaches     
     
Dinner      
-1 cup Explore Cuisine Black Bean Spaghetti + 1 tbsp coconut aminos       
-1 cup cauliflower stir fry (cauliflower, bell pepper, onion, garlic, spot of avocado oil)      
-2 medjool dates      
      
Snacks     
-3/4 cup riced cauliflower + 2 tbsp hummus     
-2 jicama tofu wraps (jicama slice, 1 tbsp guacamole, 1 gram tofu, 1 tsp pico de gallo)           
-Mini peanut butter Larabar      
-1 cup black bean soup       
-4 peanut butter pretzels      
-Rice cake + 1 tbsp guacamole + 1 tbsp pico de gallo     
-Other half of banana + 1 tsp peanut butter     
-Another 1/3 cup frozen blueberry + peaches    
         
TL;DR Been plant-based for 10+. Pregnant and diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Nurse hasn't contacted me yet with next steps, but might not be vegan-focused anyway. Will need to learn about diabetes and figure out a meal plan.",0

Please don't eat canned fish.,0,bm81dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/bm81dm/please_dont_eat_canned_fish/,20,1557364967.0,"Sorry if this is a bit of a ramble/rant but I felt like I needed to share this.

Canned fish (or at the very least the type I was eating which was tuna canned in water) has a non-trivial amount of oxidized cholesterol in it which is incredibly bad for you.

https://thepaleodiet.com/canned-tuna-may-increase-oxidized-cholesterol/

You probably won't notice the effects unless you have advanced atherosclerosis like I do, which I've been dealing with ever since my heart attack & stroke in late 2015. 

Early on I didn't notice any problems but by late 2016/early 2017 I found that eating even just one can of tuna made my heart throw a huge fit later in the day and the day after too. I went off canned fish and had my symptoms improve and was puzzled by this for the longest time until (in 2018) I found out about the dangers of oxidized cholesterol and its presence in canned fish, and subsequently also learned about keto and fasting, the latter of which probably saved my life. I can eat eggs and salmon cooked with butter (low temp) with no issues, because it's not the cholesterol that's a hazard to your health but its oxidized counterpart.

I've also learned from a keto channel that a study found that 'mildly' oxidized cholesterol is almost as bad as cholesterol which has been massively oxidized with copper:

https://youtu.be/ofq-8ToY2fc?t=916

""...[minimally oxidized LDL] killed 40% of the endothelial cells in culture.""
""So they then got LDL and oxidized with copper and massively oxidized it and they found out it only killed around 45% of the cells.""

The endothelial cells are the cells that line the inner surface of your blood vessels.

So for the sake of your health please do not eat canned fish. Go for something like wild caught frozen salmon instead, it's much, much better for you.﻿",1

Please help me understand something,0,a3pjlk,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/a3pjlk/please_help_me_understand_something/,12,1544142930.0,"Please correct me if I'm wrong on anything here:

So it's my understanding that when you intake carbs, your body converts those carbs to glucose, which causes an insulin spike and insulin's presence is what causes the body to store the sugar in your blood as fat. So the whole thing with keto (in addition to getting your body to run off fat) is making it so that you don't spike your insulin so that your body isn't receiving the signals to store food as fat. 

Here's the part that I don't understand: is this saying that it's literally not possible to put on fat while on keto? Regardless of whether you're on keto or not, thermodynamics still comes in to play, so if calories in>calories out, you'd still put on weight (but at the same time, *how* because isn't your body not getting the signal to store fat)?

Someone please explain. I just started looking into keto (literally yesterday), so I may be missing a big piece of the puzzle here. Thanks!",1

I’m 4’10 and was 209 lbs. I got down to 196.8 on October 6th, but I’ve been stuck at 198 ish since then. I have Hashimoto’s, PCOS, Pseudotumor Cerebri, and ADHD. I had a shunt placed in July, my doctor has recently bumped my levothyroxine up to 75 mcg, I’m being medicated for ADHD, and my doctor is thinking about putting me on metformin for my PCOS. Basically what I’m saying is my health problems are semi-under control—except for my weight. 

I am not cleared to exercise yet. I fast between 16 and 21 hours a day. Most of the time it’s around 18 hours. I’m not eating enough calories during my eating window—but I get so full that there is no way I can eat more without making myself sick. What am I supposed to do? I typically eat any combination of salami, some kind of cheese (havarti, Colby Jack, provolone), I’ll usually drink a La Croix, I’ll have one sometimes two squares of Choczero Chocolate, or Lilly’s milk chocolate, a single pouch of pistachios, and typically some raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries. 

A chunk of my carbs come from my supplements which include, Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Vitamin B Complex, a probiotic, and an Ashwagandha, Damiana, and Maca blend. I usually end up eating around 500 or so calories and around 13  net carbs. 9 carbs are from my supplements. I’ll typically end up eating between like 30 and 50 grams of protein in a day.

I also weigh every morning even though I know I shouldn’t. I’m currently away on a work trip for 21 days and purposely didn’t bring my scale. 


Please help. Any suggestions? I’m going to add more veggies in (I love most veggies), I just typically break my fast with meat, cheese, and pistachios, and after that I’m pretty much full.  Any suggestions other than adding veggies? I’m at a loss. ☹️


TLDR; I’m severely obese and have a ton of health problems and can’t seem to truly lose weight on IF and keto.


Edited to add, I don’t eat **ALL** of the food listed above every day. Just some combination of what’s listed. I use a tracking app which is how I got my numbers. I took a screen shot of one of my days to add to this post but didn’t know how to do so.

Please help...Trying to leave keto behind,10,iz5lmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/iz5lmh/please_helptrying_to_leave_keto_behind/,16,1601009618.0,"Hello everyone, first time on this thread

I'd like to start off by saying that I used to be vegetarian for a while (and going back and forth between being vegan and vegetarian for a bit)...But in the past year or so, I've gained a lot of weight, mostly because my work is SO busy and I'm usually shoving whatever is premade and ready to eat into my mouth and calling it a day (I'm oftentimes working till 3-4am). I know I needed to lose at least 25-30lb and was sucked into the whole keto lifestyle, because I was SO desperate to lose this weight...I did my best to go as vegan or as close to vegan as possible (Unfortunately, I had fish, eggs, butter...ugh the GUILT) and am missing my fruits and sweet potatoes and rice and all that good stuff SO much.

Did I lose weight? I mean, yes I lost a few, but I feel nauseous with all this fat (and animal product) in my system so I do want to switch to WFPBD but I'm scared. A big part of my brain keeps screaming ""you're going to get fat off all that carb again"" eventhough RATIONALLY I KNOW that sweet potato, beans and rice are probably not the problem. I've driven myself MAD with this obsession with losing weight and keeping it off (I'll admit now that I've done some crazy diets in the past), especially because I also gain weight SO easily...to the point where my husband is wondering how I'm gaining so much considering how many calories I consume (I promise, it's really not that much)

I'm so torn, and I'm also not confident that I'll be able to make the time to cook all the dishes I find online. So I want to hear from all you seasoned plant-based folks here perhaps your stories on weightloss (I know it's not healthy to be so fixated but I just CANT get over it yet. I'm stressing out HORRIBLY over it)  and tips on taking the weight off and keeping it off...as well as if this diet has really helped you with stabilizing hormones and your sleep quality. Oh, and before keto, my issue was also that I SWELL up overnight to the point where I wake up most mornings groggy and my joints (esp finger joints) in pain. I retain a LOT of water on high carb diet for some reason, but I'm probably doing something wrong.

And I'd SUPER appreciate any lazy-simple-but-nutritionally dense recipes that I can fix up in like..10 min. If it helps, I do like Asian food, Mexican flavors, I like spicy stuff and I don't find the need to really re-create vegan versions of things like mac'n cheese or fried chicken or whatever (Don't really like those to begin with). I like drinking my meals too (but I don't know if that's frowned upon. I love my vitamix) I'm only saying this because if I'm not tempted to eat it, I'm 99.9% certain I'll go right back to eating premade stuff and mess everything up again and work like an idiot fueled by CRAP.

I'd appreciate any tips. Or anything that will help get it through my head that WFPBD is the right way to go and I need to stop being scared of it (keto brainwashing is real)

Sorry for all the rambling. I'm so stressed out...

&#x200B;

EDIT/UPDATE: I took everyone's advice, read a couple of the books as much as I could and switched to plantbased without fear of starch! I did gain some water weight back but SHOCKINGLY I'm losing weight (more than I did on keto!) on my diet primarily of rice and beans (I'm a lazy cook lol) THIS WORKS GUYS! Hopefully I'll do an actual update post or something like a month later. THIS IS AWESOME! THANK YOU EVERYONE!",0

The finished product was definitely more on the orange side and looked fairly homogenous, a lot like an immersion blender was used to achieve the finished product; it was NOT a watery concoction with chunks of veggies in it at all.

So, I humbly ask you: **how the heck should I cook the zucchini I bought? Steam? Roast? Boil?** I'm leaning towards roasting it along with some sweet potatoes and onions then just tossing it all into my vitamix along with some water or veggie stock, but I thought I'd ask here first. I've boiled sweet potatoes and I think they lose more of their flavor to the water compared to roasting them, so I really have no clue where to go with this. Please help!",0

Going to try a mortar and pestle next, but had a thought of ""dehydrating"" it in a warm oven, but worried if that will remove some of the health benefits? Open to ideas.

Update:
So I attempted the mortar and pestle idea, the trouble is that they only work when you've got the elbow grease and I'm having sleeping trouble, so I'm pretty much running on fumes. I added some of my plant fat and it lasted maybe 5ish minutes and I don't believe I made enough progress to make it a regular plan. I did however try blending it in small batches, thinking that it would be more condensed this way, it would have less places to hide in the blender. This actually did seem to work better, and after running it for a minute, I blended in the rest of my ingredients for another minute on high speed.
After running the final product through my ice cream maker, I could no longer taste any granules, though they are still visible in the bowl, but that might be some of my coconut milk reacting weird to the freezing process. So a lesson for anyone trying to better mix hemp seeds, blend in small amounts with around 1:1 ratio for a bit, then add it to your larger batch.",0

Protein Rant,3,7rcmbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7rcmbh/protein_rant/,8,1516335724.0,"I'm seeing a lot of posts about people drinking protein shakes, using them as meal replacements, etc.

Casual reminder that this is a lifestyle change. I get that you are leaning on old habits and you think a shake as meal replacement is the best method, but think long term. The best way to approach keto is through a balanced, nutritious way of eating. Please push towards incorporating greens, healthy meats, and the occaisional protein shake. If you eat meat and veggies, you'll hit your protein and fat macros nutritiously and deliciously. Burgers, chicken, pork, spinach, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, avocados(thank the heavens), etc.

Most of you are trying to lose a lot of weight, that is great and I applaud you. Do it responsibly, carefully, and moderate your protein. If you are going to habitually eat too much of a macro, stick to fat. That is our fuel. Yes, some of you are working out very intensely, but for most, it's simply not the case. Keep those proteins below 1.2g/pound of LEAN BODY MASS. For me, I'm 177, and have 135 pounds of lean body mass. That means, at my max, I can consume 155 or so(head math) grams of protein. Honestly I am seeing muscle gains in the gym consuming around 120.

I am by no means an expert, and am fairly new to keto myself(props to you multi year veterans), but we are not protein mongrels. We are fat fiends.

Get that through your heads, sissies: people in this subreddit are succeeding while you are failing.  It's YOUR responsibility to change, to have some damn willpower, to pick yourself up if you fall.  We can offer advice, but YOU have to do this for yourself...that means reading the FAQ, doing your own research, and actually coming to the conclusion that keto is for you.  Maybe it isn't, you know.  Maybe you'd like to try eating smaller portions of what you've always eaten; maybe it will work *this* time.  Maybe you want to eat all of everything all the time, and you have aspirations to be the world's fattest.  That's fine, but please don't come here to have us do your work, and don't expect all of us to be incredibly supportive when you bemoan your third cheat day in your first week; that is you encouraging yourself to fail, and I'm going to call you out on it whenever I see it.

For convenience (and because I find them delicious) I have been consuming quest bars daily as I believed them to be a safe keto food (included the 5g net carb claim of the bar in my daily macros) 

It was only when my type 1 diabetic boyfriend ate one for breakfast this week and told me he had a massive spike in his blood sugar having not eaten anything else. So I stopped them for a few days and got the first time in my keto history I have been getting my first proper pink ketostix.

I have a question for you guys. I'm an avid crossfit athlete and have been eating clean for about a year now (very strictly). I recently decided to go flexitarian and incorporate a plant-based routine Monday through Friday.

The way my eating habits work is that I do a form of macrocounting. I do 4 meals a day with certain preset numbers (in grams) depending on what hat cut I'm in. Right now I'm in maintenance and just trying to stay at my current weight with the ability to eat more and stay ""shredded"". I knew plant based would allow me to achieve this bc I need a higher caloric intake.

For perspective, one meal is essentially split into 4 groups. A carb (22g), a protein (30g), a fat (5g), and 2 handfuls of greens. I've decided to swap out my meat proteins for Plant based using lentils, tempeh, and seitan as replacements. I've been hearing that Seitan isnt the best even though it's low carb and fat with a high protein count. As an athlete is seitan an okay substitute for 1 of the 4 meals daily?

Hey everyone,  I have a few questions.  I started low carb back in March, and for the most part stuck to my macros, but I don't think I ever really achieved Ketosis because the blood monitor never went above .3. I know this was because I was eating too much protein and lots of sugar free stuff.  I lost 55 pounds in the process.  I decided to go serious Keto this past Tuesday (5 days ago) and actually counted my macros hard core (5% carbs, 20% Protein and 75% fat)  My keto monitor yesterday finally said .8 and I had lost 10 lbs, most of which I'm sure was water since I had cheated for the past few weeks.  This morning I woke up...have gained 2 lbs and now my monitor reads .3.  I have not messed up my macros.

So, my understanding is that sodium is necessary. When attempting to lower sodium to try to get my BP down, I actually had some symptoms of too-low sodium. I increased up slightly, but I still have to make sure I eat olives or pickles or drink some Gatorade on the days I have longer runs (10 miles or so), or else I either have bad light-headedness or severe headaches. Dr Greger doesn't seem to have much about making sure to get enough sodium on a wfpb diet? 

My BP is still in the pre-hypertensive zone, despite 100 lbs of weight loss (now bmi of about 21.5), eating something around a Mediterranean diet, and eating pretty low-sodium. (Low enough to have to focus on having enough). That's the primary reason I'm wfpb-curious. Currently, I eat meat around once or twice a week, with that usually being fish, and I currently have eggs or yogurt around twice a week. I eat minimal amounts of processed foods, but am looking to limit those further... I haven't fully decided whether I'm ready to go 100% wfpb, or just have more wfpb meals. 

Anyway, so far the sodium discussion has been the main thing I'm confused on. I don't fully understand yet how that fits with my needs as an amateur run/jogger.

I’ve always been a dedicated animal lover, believing that farm animals experience feelings, emotions, loyalty, and fear just like domestic pets. Having spent time in my twenties on a small dairy farm, I know this to be true in regards to our cows. Several years ago I became a pescatarian, and when for health reasons I learned I needed to have a gluten free diet, began eating poultry in order to have more dining options when traveling- so I no longer consider myself a vegetarian but still do not eat pork or beef. I’ve now realized that a low carb diet fits my body’s needs best. I’m wrestling with eating pork and beef but am struggling with making this transition. We have the resources to source meat in an ethically and environmentally responsible way, however I am struggling to get past the thoughts about the animals themselves having bonds and trust in their caregivers, only to be killed by them (or worse in my mind, shipped to slaughter).  I respect that for some this is the way of life - they raise the animal for meat, give it a good life, and then slaughter. I have no issue with meat consumption by others — I am just trying to figure this out for myself. When I’ve tried to eat beef before, I couldn’t get the image of “my” cows out of my head and just couldn’t enjoy myself. Has anyone here had this experience, thought process, or dilemma?

Being fat simply being a life choice is just not the case and not only this, the dietary recommendations of Canada and the United States lead to obesity in many people following them the best they can.

REPORT TO CONGRESS: LOW-CARB DIET YIELDS GROUNDBREAKING RESULTS FOR T2 DIABETES,2129,9vwdwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9vwdwp/report_to_congress_lowcarb_diet_yields/,392,1541901795.0,"At last - Congress is hearing about the keto diet from the amazing Sarah Hallberg, that has reversed diabetes in so many cases (as several people in this keto subreddit already know from their own experience). 

Heard her speak at the low carb conference last weekend and she was great. 

Apparently many of the committee members who came up with the recent dietary guidelines for USA were vegetarian! 
Hopefully this will start to change soon, with fresh personnel, with fresh ideas. 

Unlike the last article I posted here, this one came out this week, so it is new - I checked the date this time 😊.

RTFM and STOP complicating things!!,0,10ogiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/10ogiz/rtfm_and_stop_complicating_things/,90,1348976453.0,"Honestly, when you post something, do you see the big banner that says 


>""I swear I have actually read the FAQ and am not posting a question that may have already have been answered 400 times previously""?


It's getting annoying to see so many ill-informed questions and posts that describe how you're doing keto (incorrectly, usually not eating enough fat) and wondering what might be wrong.

Keto is the simplest fucking diet out there:


*Keep your ratio 65/30/5

*Create a calorie deficit


That's keto.  Here's the complicated parts (largely common sense):


*Drink plenty of water (2L+ a day)

*If you get keto flu, increase water and electrolytes

*Track every single thing you eat


There's nothing magic about this, you still need to eat fewer calories to lose weight.  Exercise is good for you, but it's not what makes you lose weight.  Want to cheat?  Well, that's not keto, but go for it, it's your choice.  Need to know what knocks you out of ketosis - ketostix.


Think for yourself a little, if you're not maintaining the proper macronutrient ratios and/or you're not creating a calorie deficit (which you won't know if you don't track), then there's no need to post a question here.


Discussions are awesome, we can learn a lot from each other and share our experiences, but answering the same question 50 times, that is CLEARLY covered quite simply in the FAQ or overview, is a bit annoying.  Also, there's this awesome new site you should check out that can answer a TON of questions about keto - [give it a try](http://www.google.com).

I think perhaps my point was not understood or maybe this will be down voted as well.

I think a low carb diet is the healthiest diet for me and possibly for any person with weight troubles. I have a friend who spent his entire childhood and early adulthood over-weight to obese and dieting constantly in his mid 30's he went Keto, or at least thought he did.

 The low fat thinking was so ingrained in his thinking he went on a what was essentially a boneless skinless chicken breast and kale diet. He ate eggs and used pam etc. He did all the low-fat things American dieters do. He lost weight like no ones business and starting dating in a way he never had while fat.  

then bang Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and a diagnosis of Rabbit starvation. The point I am trying to make is fat is our friend. It keeps us from being hungry, it contains the fatty acids we need . It makes food taste lovely. 

I don't believe in hitting ""macros"" or fat bombs but when on keto is is best to avoid lean meat and the fat shunning habits of the standard american diet.  ",1

Dead from diabetes, grandma and oldest brother. Incapacitated from stroke dad and uncle. 

Ok so knowing this history you'd think we would as a group change the way we eat.  Research, read, study, try something so we all don't die.  But no it's just pills and doctor visits and death.  

About a year ago I started eating Keto.  I've been to the doctor.  I've lowered my  blood pressure, cholesterol, and my a1c is a 5.  I feel better mentally than I have my entire life.  The constant pain and depression is gone.  I only lost 35 pounds.  I'm still fat, but I feel so damn healthy.  I sleep better, when I'm awake I'm actually awake.  I get stuff done.  Being alive feels good. 

So to continue with my family story, I went to a wedding shower for my niece.  They had a ""pasta bar"" and a ""dessert bar""  Holy shit, it was carbs as far as they eye could see.  Being the rude bitch I am (according to people who think it's rude not to accept the hospitality) I didn't eat anything.  I drank black coffee and watched my mother eat. And eat she did, penne Alfredo, lasagna, breadsticks, and cake.  20 min later she was in my car literally crying.  Sweaty, cold, red, nauseous, dizzy.  I probably should have taken her to the hospital.  She was crying ""my body has betrayed me!""  It was horrible.  And I was angry.  Why does she do this to herself? Why do my family think this is ok? She texted me a day later and said ""for some reason my blood sugar spiked""  Really mom?? For some reason?

She's 28 years older than me.  I'm going to eat low carb for the next 30 years and enjoy the next 30  years of my life.  I fucking refuse to do that to myself.  I am NOT going to die like that.  I'm going to change my family.  My son is not going to be fat and diabetic.  Hes not going to have to watch me suffer in 30 years.  I am going to break this cycle.  Watch me.",1

Reached Goal Weight Today; Ready to reveal my Before & After :) [229 SW > 159 CW],69,jczbhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jczbhm/reached_goal_weight_today_ready_to_reveal_my/,16,1602984547.0,"As the title says, I've never been able to do a before and after, but I'm stoked after hitting my first major milestone (goal weight) through a combination of IF, Keto, CICO and ""just moving"". I started by walking, and walking, and walking... accumulating 1 million steps over the course of July, Aug and Sept (over 500k in Aug alone!). The heat helped with the initial water weight. Progress really is the best motivator too. Once I saw the results starting to happen, it became easier to dedicate. Sparing the shirtless selfie, but the abs are coming along nicely too :)

&#x200B;

**Typical routine:** 

* 5:30am coffee with Keto Collagen
* Watch the world burn on the morning news, get pissed
* 6:00am walk (now running on the treadmill) - usually just a mile
* Shower and work interlaced with what I call ""random acts of fitness"" (I keep dumbbells around my work area, pullup bar in the doorframe - one toilet full of prison wine away from full Debo workout - hide yo chain!)
* Get frustrated at work, take a walk (run now)
* More keto collagen coffee (2 french presses by 2pm - zing!)

\---

FINALLY - time to eat! 230p-630p (Trader Joes FTW!)

Menu Items:

Spinach Kale Dip

Taziki (however the eff you spell it) cucumber dip

carrots (edible fiber spoons FTW!)

celery

almond butter

chicken

shrimp

zuchini noodles

Things of the above nature - low carb, fiber is a plus, and high fat (keto collagen has 2.5g fat too IIRC)

\---

More working out, and an early bed time. Rinse, repeat, trade cartons of cigarettes. Fuck you 2020, but I'm making the most of the circumstances (the 1 hour in the yard is epic!)

[edit: added another face photo] 

There are so many benefits to this diet, not only the weight loss. 
- extra energy 
- No more plantar fasciitis 
- No longer super sleepy 


My only downside I have received is I have more face breakouts and I never had them before. Damn chin and jawline pimples!! 


I started out making all sorts of treats and fat bombs and such but it was so much work, and my boyfriend would eat them all up so fast. 
I’ve slowly drifted off and now only make them for special occasions. 

Snack - wise I eat sugar free jello almost daily and smart sweets gummy bears occasionally. 
I don’t need them, but if temptations are running high- I like to indulge. 

Otherwise my meals are pretty consistent. Meat and veggie! Caesar salad, Broccoli! Cauliflower has so many options as to how to prepare it- and I’m getting a little better in making it. 

I haven’t gone to a gym once, however my work as a mailman is pretty physical, so I walk on average 10K 5 days a week. 
That has helped me to be distracted enough not to boredom eat. 
I don’t eat until I come home from work, which can be around 6-7pm some nights and only eat until about 10pm. Fasting otherwise. 

The worst part is I guess I have body dysmorphia. 
I still look down and see fat me. But the pictures don’t lie, and neither does the scale. 
I swear I think I lost all my weight from the top down- losing from the face and chest in the first couple months and finally my thighs and butt are finally taking some different shapes! 


Honestly, TAKE THE BEFORE PICTURE!
It helps at every step along the way to see how you have progressed. 

I have snuck in some “cheats” because that’s life- and I think now I have enough self power to be able to eat one chip, or have one cookie and walk away. (At special occasions) 
I don’t have any chronic issues as some of you might- so take that as you will, you may not be able to do the same. 

I think I gained all my weight in the past from boredom eating. Just sitting on the couch watching tv- and needing to eat something. Of course, I never ate anything *good* for me. 

I am determined to not gain back this weight, although it may happen at some point down the road- I can’t let that bog me down. 
I am here for the health benefits as well as all the new clothing I’ve had to purchase! 

Overall, a life changer. If you’re thinking about starting this diet- just do it. 
If you keep saying next Monday, just try to start now ! Clean out your pantry! Clean out your fridge if you can- eliminate the temptation. 
If you slip up- it’s ok- as long as you get right back on after. 

Can’t figure out how to change my flair right now- I’m at SW: 220 GW:150 CW: 151 

I have gone from an XL to a S/ M shirt. 

Pant size 18 to size 8. 

KCKO!!!!! 


EDIT: 

Thank you everyone for all of your kind words! I never expected anywhere near this response! 

I see I’ve inspired some of you to continue with your goals, or start brand new and I’m so so happy to hear it! 
In my own life I’ve inspired my auntie and brother in law. 

When I started I never thought I could do it, and here we are only a short time later. 
I ate like complete crap before- basically a 180. It’s amazing. 

If I can do it, so can you.

Anyone got any tips for maintenance please? I love the diet, love the food groups so happy to stay on this as a lifestyle change but I really don't want to lose anymore weight while carrying on burning belly fat, its reduced a lot but its not tight and I want tight.

I have the carbmanager app and its bumped my calories up by 600 and fats by a bit so I'm guessing to carry on as normal but eat more, I'm a bit nervous about putting weight back on though, the app has pushed my net carbs allowance up to 26g from 20g, do you think this sounds right to stay in fat burning mode?

Anyone been in this position who have any pointers? Did you start introducing foods you've been restricting or carrying on but just eating more? How do cheat days work? Can they be fit in or does it mess with ketosis too much?

Thanks in advance.",1

-	“insulin-dependent diabetics are the only patients that need to be careful on strict keto”
-	“no, eating tons of eggs and bacon is not going to spike your cholesterol. That’s not the way cholesterol levels in the blood work. What you eat is virtually meaningless in that aspect, it is all genetics.”
-	“urine strips are more or less useless for you”
-	(when describing this egg-only 5-day thing my gf is doing) “that’s fine, it’s healthy. Eggs are amazing and an almost perfect food. I wouldn’t do it for a month, but as a quick diet-jumpstart it’s fine.”

Recipe Advice?,1,je6ekw,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/je6ekw/recipe_advice/,2,1603158056.0,"Hey guys :)

I've had an idea that is probably mad... I need to use up some beef mince and was wondering if I make it into a pizza base somehow?

My plan is to try and squeeze as much juice out if it as I can, add some eggs and almond flour (to try and dough it up), and then bake it. Then add all the toppings and so on.

Do you think this could work? I figure, if it turns out to be a big old mess, it should still be tasty anyway.

Any tips for my experiment? Words of warning? Thanks!",1

I haven’t posted in about a year and after my experience today, I thought I’d share my progress. Over the past year, I’ve maintained between 215-225 lbs (down from 290+) with a mixture of lazy keto, IF and the occasional cheat meal. For some reason after about 3 weeks on keto, I get the urge to cheat, eat a pizza or Chinese food, immediately regret it, feel like absolute crap and then get back on the keto train. With the summer weather finally here, I am buckling down to work on actually getting to my 180 lb goal with strict keto, IF and daily walking. 

Anyway, I went to get my drivers license renewed today and the lady at the counter looked at my passport picture and up at me and then back again and back up at me. She just says, “holy crap! There’s no way that’s you!” I laugh and told her I’ve lost around 80 lbs since that picture was taken. She brings the picture over to the other two women at the desk, they look up at me and back down again. One of them starts clapping and soon all three women are standing and clapping. It was a pretty neat experience, albeit a little embarrassing considering the huge amount of people in the lobby. The woman proceeded to take my new picture and brought up the two photos side by side on the computer for me to look at. I’ve never seen a random stranger so proud of my progress!

According to John Hopkins, cooled rice and potatoes have resistant starches, not starches, which are not digested? So it doesn’t count as a carb?

According to the video, the potato still did raise blood glucose.

So, what does the rice count as? Are the calories still the same? Do I count the carbs? 

BTW: I probably won’t eat rice regardless. But it’ll be good to know, so I have the option. I’m more interested in the science, so please... don’t just say “I wouldn’t risk it, I don’t like rice.”. That’s not why I’m asking, and really isn’t contributing to the discussion.",1

Should we be restricting chickpea consumption? They have a high fat content compared to other legumes and a very unfavorable 6:3 ratio. And they're quite calorie-dense.

Apparently, a 6:3 ratio exceeding 4:1 is not so good and the more calorie dense, the worse.

TLDR: On my journey with keto, I am down 50 pounds and look and feel better than ever! Slow and steady wins the race.

Hey everyone! Longtime lurker here, and finally brave enough to post. Background info: I lost about 25 pounds my freshman year of college (2011-2012) doing the CICO method and working out, which got me down to about the weight I am now. Life happened, and I wound up gaining 50+ pounds by 2017. I started PA school in July, and saw a flier for a weight loss support group at the health center and decided to go. I knew I needed to get healthier, because how am I going to profess health to patients when clearly I don't make good choices?

I went to the meeting and made an appointment with the doctor, who specializes in obesity management. He got bloodwork from me, and it turned out I was insulin resistant from all of the weight I had gained and damage I had done to my body over the previous years. For some reason, he didn't check a hemoglobin A1C so I have no idea what that was back then. I had to start metformin and I was heartbroken. One of my classmates had been doing keto so I decided to talk to her about it. It made sense: too many carbs leads to diabetes, so cutting them out would help, right? She pointed me to Reddit and other keto websites for advice, and has been a huge supporter of mine since.

I committed from September to late November. Thanksgiving and Christmas made me give in and stop. I told myself I'd get back on it for the new year, but it didn't happen. I didn't want to go through the keto flu while I was trying to study. I put it off and put it off until I had gained back 13 of the pounds I had lost. During my 2nd rotation, I got on the scale and saw 176.5. That's when it finally kicked my butt into gear. I started eating keto again, and the keto flu consisted of a migraine for one evening and night, then I was over it (I def could have dealt with that earlier in the year, but oh well).

I was eating keto with the occasional Zumba for Wii work out, but I wasn't really doing much else. I went from 176.5 down to 156 by Christmas. I fell off the wagon again, but this time it was only for one week. On New Year's Eve (which was on a Monday) I started Focus T25. I had done it one time before with CICO and had pretty good results from it. I committed, giving myself only my birthday to do as I pleased with what I ate. And on my birthday, I was miserable from all the carbs! I did every workout every day for 10 weeks, supplementing Zumba for Wii on my 'rest days' and adding it when I wasn't going anywhere on top of the T25 workouts. Over the course of 10 weeks, I am down another 20 pounds, giving me a grand total of 50 pounds lost on keto over the last two years! I start Gamma phase on Monday, which will be more weight training. My hemoglobin A1C in November was 4.7%, and my primary care provider (who is also a PA and one of my mentors) told me I really didn't need the metformin anymore!

I just wanted to share my story and my results in the hopes that it will inspire other people who are struggling, especially for petite women. I know on the days I felt the lowest, I would look for scale and non-scale victory posts for inspiration. I am so glad I have before and after pictures, because I was really struggling mentally with the mirror and how I looked. Thank you Reddit for being so inspiring and giving such great advice!",1

Sabotaging Myself 😩,1,jce6yk,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jce6yk/sabotaging_myself/,20,1602898151.0,"So as a southerner, I’ve always used lots of butter. Butter goes in everything here. I’ve not been tracking my macros, just mentally counting carbs. So thanks to my using butter in everything, I’ve probably been consuming triple my fat and calories for the last 5 weeks that I’ve been on keto. Working to improve that, I’ve weighed and logged everything I’ve put in my mouth today. 


I had also been eating a bag of Russel Stover SF PB cups every night. Or their version of snickers. Didn’t think it was a big deal as it was only 4-5g of carbs per bag BUT that’s an additional 300+ calories per day plus all the BS ingredients. So even tho I am on day 37 of keto, I’m pretty much starting over today because I’ve been unintentionally sabotaging myself 😩😩 

These realizations have hit me hard today and have me feeling super disappointed. I was so proud that I’d been so consistent for 5 weeks only to realize I wasn’t doing it right the whole time. This makes sense as to why I haven’t lost any weight (I’d made a previous post about that..)",1

My partner and I have just started Keto, day 7 and we’ve lots a few pounds each! We absolutely love it. It’s challenging, but we are feeling better and reeeeally enjoying peanuts and biltong! 

My question to you esteemed Keto community of Reddit, is how do you get your fats in without consuming a huge amount of saturated fats? 

To throw a spanner in the works, my partner heavily dislikes fish AND avacado, to the point his gag reflex kicks off. I’m happy to make avacado brownies etc and he will eat those.

Save 20-80% on ALL your Fruit/Veg Purchases with this 1 simple ''Trick'',8,9vy1c8,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/9vy1c8/save_2080_on_all_your_fruitveg_purchases_with/,7,1541913974.0,"Well it's actually just common sense which I almost never see being used, at least here in UK where a LOT of the vegetables/fruits are being priced per piece or per pack.

For example you can purchase loose broccoli here for about £1.50 per 1kg, or you can purchase broccoli wrapped in plastic and sold for around £0.60 per piece ,On the packaging it says there are 350grams and it's priced based on that weight...However... How are you supposed to grow a perfect 350gram broccoli every time?


I guess at this point you already know the ''super special trick''

-Look for the largest pre-packaged broccoli head and take that!

&nbsp;


Here are some examples,

-Aldi Sells 800g cabbages for 49p, in reality you can find some that are 1.4-1.6kg in the lot

-Tesco sells 350g broccoli, in reality you can sometimes find packs that are 700-800g in weight.

-Aldi I think sells bananas at 13p a piece, you can find/pick some humongous ones.

-Aldi sells sweetpotatoes at like 50p a piece, sometimes you can find some that are almost 1 kg each in weight.

-Lidl sells 1kg of sweetpotatoes loose for 99p per 1kg , or 97p for a pack of 1kg ( in reality in the packs there are like 1.2kg of them!)

-When you get a pack of apples/any fruit, make sure you feel the weight of multiple packs and get the heavier ones - You still pay the same price!

-Getting something large like a Pineapple? Get the heaviest one! You still pay the same price...


&nbsp;


I could go on and on with examples...If just starting out, and if the store has scales in-store , Use them until you get the hang of it, I can just take the stuff in 2 hands and tell even the slightest difference in weight.

Takes barely any extra time and the savings adds up and are Huge.

"Saw Game Changers tonight, kinda disappointed, didn't think it was all that great. Have you seen it and what do you think?",1,d5b0b7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/d5b0b7/saw_game_changers_tonight_kinda_disappointed/,33,1568717632.0,"Saw the movie at a theatre in north central Florida. Maybe 12-20 other people attended. The other people seemed to enjoy it, but I'm not really sure, because one enthusiastic person can sort of skew things, as can a few busy or distracted people.

First off, it's a sports movie. They're changing the game of sports, not changing the culinary game, or agriculture game, or medical game, or business game, or political game. 

So the movie starts out following a fighter, like a cage fighter, or ultimate fighting or something. He blew both knees and needs to recover quickly so he researches plants as food. I can't recall now whether they call it vegan or plant based eating.

At some point his dad has a heart attack and talks to Dr Ess via skype and slowly regains his health on plant based diet but this takes about 90 seconds of screen time.

It's not really the fighter's story most of the time. The fighter doesn't really interview the people in the movie, he does't interview Arnold. Don't think he was there when Rip was feeding the firemen in Brooklyn. Don't think he was there during the Tennessee titans season. Don't think he interviewed the doctors. At least that's the way I recall. So the narrator disappears. The movie is really not his story. 

So it's disjointed or unfocused or rambling a bit.

So this movie is a bunch of stories strung together about vegan or plant based athletes. It's really sort of choppy. Point is, you should eat this way to win at your sport, that is the theme of the movie.

The athletes are Scott Jurek, who is an ultra runner attempting to break the speed record on the Appalachian Trail; a strongman who lifts heavy things and grows unusual sideburns; lotsa Tennessee Titans and somebody's wife who is a chef; some other Ultimate fighters; a woman cyclist who wins gold at age 39, and some college athletes who get stronger and longer night-time erections after eating bean burritos. There are more body builders including that young vegan who has never eaten meat, forgot his name, and an older guy, a coach, in his 60's who says his grandkids can't keep up with him. 

Oh Arnold gives some interviews, he is so watchable, not really related to the story line, but he's funny and the camera loves him. And some doctors occasionally give sound bites. 

The best part was when they suddenly started explaining how much water and grain it takes to produce meat, and this sort of more educational approach. When they started to explain the system of meat, and what it does to the planet, this was where it started getting interesting. However this part was way too fast, and de-emphasized, and the graphics either sucked or were not as helpful as they should have been. Really this should have been the entire movie, the game changer, the information about what meat and dairy eating is doing to the planet and what corporate and political forces are doing it.

There is really nothing about how to actually cook, but there is food in the movie. Looks slathered in oil and i think they use tofu and a lot of meat substitutes. These athletes seem to want to eat fake fried chicken and fake burgers and lots of fake cheese. I don't eat that so.  

Forks over Knives and Kip's two movies are easier to love, better to recommend to people, especially women.  

Sorry Mr Cameron, I don't care whether the Titans win another game. But if we lose the polar ice caps, or the Amazon, or parts of the world lose their soil quality, or parts lose their fresh water... all because of our meat eating follies, well that is a movie I would watch and watch again. 

And maybe Jurek should slow down and enjoy nature instead of racing thru it. The cycling team won by what, a tenth of a second? So what, it's absurd, to practice for years for that, when they're basically all equally champions. And as for all the fighters, the blood sports, the military training, the body builders, the brain-damaging football players, well, I don't recommend that, can't relate at all, and it feels weird and rather narcissistic and almost homoerotic to spend so much screen time adoring that. Can they build a community instead of a bicep?",0

I've been reading the posts here for a bit now, feeling so inspired by the great success people have had. I've noticed the flair people have marking their progress towards their goal and realized I don't even know what my goal weight will be. I've never truly been at a healthy weight in my life, and I know you can find charts online that tell you where you should be, but I think I'm going to determine it for myself when I get there. In the meantime, I've set the goal in my head that I never want to hear the ""compliment"" ""you have such a pretty face!"" again. I don't want people to make that backhanded distinction that only my face looks good, but nothing else does. Starting at 367 lbs (my highest ever) I certainly have a ways to go, but for the first time in my life, I feel like I can actually do it. I have y'all to thank, even though you didn't know I existed until this moment. No matter how this goes, thank you for adding to my courage to try.

Hi everyone! Let’s start by saying something about the title; scared, because I’ll always be that woman feeling insecure about my body. Ashamed because of all the junk I did put in my body.

Now.. I feel honoured to see such a change. Overall I haven’t lost that MUCH weight as some of you, but this morning I woke up and was like “where did all of that body go?!”  And I saw some abs showing (or is that what I want to believe ;) ) haha. 

I came across Keto about a year ago, when I was researching epilepsy and PTSD. 
I haven’t stuck to Keto all year round to be honest, it was an on and off journey due to personal circumstances. And once I was back on  Keto (read: when magically the scale went up after 2 months of bread, pasta and cakes), I did different variations/experimenting of IF/OMAD etc. 

I found now what really works for me and that is eating lunch + dinner, so 2 meals per day. I do have a fast every day of approx. 17 hours. 
My macros are: 5 carbs (18 grams), 25 protein (95 grams) and 70 fat (119 grams). Calorie intake per day: 1500. 

Best of all: my epilepsy medication has gone down to a minimum, while the neurologist before said we have to higher the dosage every year. 

Tip: keep your meals simple. And plan ahead.

Scientists have discovered a simple way to cook rice that dramatically cuts the calories,0,30aenr,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/30aenr/scientists_have_discovered_a_simple_way_to_cook/,2,1427341918.0,"Cross post from /r/science

This is an interesting article for a couple of different reasons.  First, I was shocked to read in a mainstream article that actually mentions that rice and starches contribute to obesity and diabetes.  

The article talks about ""digestible starches that take only a little time to digest, are quickly turned into glucose, and then later glycogen. Excess glycogen ends up adding to the size of our guts if we don't expend enough energy to burn it off."" 

And then it continues with ""Other starches, meanwhile, called resistant starches, take a long time to for the body to process, aren't converted into glucose or glycogen because we lack the ability to digest them, and add up to less calories.""

Shocking!  I'm usually used to hearing ""all starches are the same.  And they are good for you!  Eat 12 servings a day!""  Keto people know better.

Second, it talks about simple preparation methods that chemically change the rice to reduce the ""digestible starches"".  It involves adding oil and then cooling the rice.  

I haven't followed up yet, but the source of the research was cited as ""Sudhair James [and his professor at the University of Sri Lanka ] presented his preliminary research at National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS) on Monday.""

I just thought everyone in this sub might be interested in this.

Serial Bowel Movements...,47,ioeoyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/ioeoyr/serial_bowel_movements/,27,1599537199.0,"Forgive me for the unappealing subject matter and please delete if not relevant, but considering that I follow the WFPB diet and diet is inextricably related to gastrointestinal function and GI-health, this seemed like an appropriate place to divulge. I would not ask this question if not for the anonymity provided by Reddit, which is part of Reddit’s magic.

I have this bodily pattern where I have consecutive BMs within a span of 2-4 hours (sometimes four in total), and it’s quite an annoyance and it makes me uncomfortable and gives me a sense of uncleanliness/unhealthiness. They are always very easy, smooth and efficient (I do not spend a lot of time on the toilet, I do not strain, the product is soft and easily passed, I feel “evacuated”, etc.) but a repeated urge then follows usually within an hour or so and this happens multiple times. I would much prefer it if I just had one single event at the beginning of the day, and then I were done with it. I eat a WFPB diet with lots of veggies, greens, legumes, grains, fruit, nuts, seeds, etc. and the only non-WFPB thing that I consume is the occasional trace amount of sauce (e.g. Sriracha, Hot-Sauce). Is this just the new normal that I need to get used to? Is this frequency what nature intended? Can I change this?

It’s also important to know that I’ve been on this diet for ~4 years, and there have been periods of time where I was “one and done” for the day, and that was nice. I’m also a 6 Foot, ~200lb male that Powerlifts (Heavy Weight training) and thus consume close to ~3000 calories—sometime more—per day. Part of me feels that the volume of food that I consume may simply be so high that this is inevitable, but I’d rather not diminish my fiber-intake since, from what I’ve read, my body should have adapted to the fiber-volume by now and this would likely require a diminished intake of vegetables, which I’d rather not do.

Example: One package said: net 3 carbs on the front, but then when you look at the label, it's REALLY like 23 carbs macros! They get away with it by not labeling some things (like sugar alcohols) as REAL carbs, BUT do include them in the total carbs label.

I looked it up, it seems to be due to the oxalate in soy binding to calcium in the body and creating kidney stones, should I cut down?

For most of the first three weeks, I was drinking a hydration mix to get my electrolytes in. This past week, however, I changed up my food a little bit so I was getting more through eating so I didn't have to drink as much of the hydration mix. I only decreased from two servings to one. 

I use Chronometer to track my macros/micros. Yesterday, it says that I had 672mg of magnesium (210% of my DV), 4399mg of potassium (169% of my DV) and 1632mg of sodium (108% of my DV). I know I had more sodium than that because I don't log the salt that I add to my meals, but the rest of it should be fairly accurate.

Yesterday, I felt almost ravenously hungry for most of the day, and then I kept waking up all night to pee and because I was having calf cramps. This morning I read a comment where someone mentioned that a lack of electrolytes can cause you to feel ravenously hungry.

What gives? According to my tracker I've had plenty of electrolytes, so why is my body acting like I haven't had any? I drank just as much water yesterday as I normally do, too, even without the hydration mix.",1
Should I be taking an iron supplement?,3,iks39b,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/iks39b/should_i_be_taking_an_iron_supplement/,12,1599020651.0,"I started eating a plant-based in April. I got blood work done in January when I was still eating meat/dairy and everything was fine. I have not had another check-up since switching my diet.

I'm wondering though if I should start taking an iron supplement. I already take 1 multivitamin, vitamin D, biotin, fish oil, and B-12 every day. I try to get iron in naturally but I admit I haven't been the best at incorporating it in my diet.

I'm a woman (early 20s) and I have a hormonal IUD (I'm including that info because I've heard sometimes birth control can affect iron levels). Of course I can ask my doctor this question, but I'm not due for another check-up for a while and I'm hesitant to go in for anything except an emergency right now due to covid.

I also have pretty thin/fine hair which I've heard can be caused by iron deficiency, but my hair was like this pre-plant-based diet. I'm hoping maybe an iron supplement would strengthen my hair, but I know that's probably wishful thinking.

If I'm *not* deficient and take an iron supplement, is that harmful? I don't mind taking iron supplements even if they don't do anything, I just don't want to potentially cause harm to myself.

Should our cholesterol and glucose levels match those of newborn babies?,1,fw2zod,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/fw2zod/should_our_cholesterol_and_glucose_levels_match/,1,1586223108.0,"I think we can all agree that the numbers most doctors live by come from the averages of a sick, meat-eating population. So I started looking at the numbers babies are born with *(aka before they ever start eating meat/cheese/eggs, though it can still be possibly influenced if the mother is eating it while baby is in the womb).* 

&#x200B;

**Here's what I found out:**

&#x200B;

\----------     

newborn cholesterol levels:       
51-96 total, 22-44 HDL, 22-44 LDL - average ""healthy"" newborn       
1.0 LDL/HDL ratio       
36 was the mean for both HDL/LDL        
50 was the mean for Triglycerides       
73 was the mean for Total cholesterol     

We are born with a total cholesterol reading down in the 30–70 mg/dL range. It quickly bounds upward, elevated by milk and fatty foods. Total cholesterol tends to creep upward with age, generally breaking into the 200s by middle age.     

A total cholesterol under 150 or an LDL under 70 can halt or even reverse atherosclerosis, the artery-clogging process at the root of heart disease, most strokes, and a variety of other disorders.      

&#x200B;

**So how low can cholesterol go and still be healthy? How low are most vegans' cholesterols? I wish we could have the numbers of people who have been vegan from birth.**

&#x200B;

\----------     

When babies are just 1 hour to 2 hours old, the normal level is just under 2 mmol/L, but it will rise to adult levels (over 3 mmol/L) within two to three days.

Newborns have blood glucose levels far lower than would be tolerable for adults and older children, yet most do not experience any ill effects. For example, in older children and adults, a blood glucose level below 60 mg per dl (deciliter) is considered low. But at birth, it's common for a newborn to have a blood glucose level as low as 30 mg per dl, which will gradually increase to 54 to 72 mg per dl. 

Breast fed babies have statistically significantly lower blood glucose concentrations (mean 3.6 mmol/l; range 1.5–5.3) in the first week of life, compared to formula fed babies (mean 4.0 mmol/l; range 2.5–6.2).

mg/dL  mmol/L   Level              
50     2.8      dangerously low       
70     3.9      low       
72     4.0      normal       
108    6.0      normal       
120    7.0      eating     

&#x200B;

fasting = less than 100 mg/dL (70-99 range, 3.9-5.5 mmol/L)     

Fasted blood sugar should be 70-100. 101-125 is prediabetes. 125 or higher is diabetes.     

After 3 to 5 days of fasting, increasing reliance on fatty acids and ketone bodies for fuel enables the body to maintain blood glucose at 60 to 65 mg/dL (normal 70 to 100 mg/dL) and to save muscle protein for prolonged periods without food.     

Circulating glucose concentrations do not drop below 3.5 mmol L−1 even in prolonged starvation.     

Carbohydrate reserves are depleted after 24h of starvation.     

&#x200B;

Your blood sugar likely fluctuates 10-20 mg/dL and anywhere between 70 and 100 mg/dL is optimal. If you fast for extended periods of time your blood sugar can go below 70 as ketones increase. One guy fasted for over a year and his blood sugar was stable around 30mg/dL at the end without any apparent issue.

It's not plant based at all, it's just less meat-centric. A lot of rice and veggies and a little meat. The coastal areas eat a good amount of fish. 

This would also suggest that animal products don't cause cancer if you have it sparingly.

So, while that study can certainly be used to show that the way most of America eats is far less healthy than most of China, it's not really something that necessarily supports the plant based thing. 

It's obvious that plant based is healthy and helping a ton of people, but maybe we should be more selective in our source material.",0

Shout out to /u/BigTexan1492,2003,amtxur,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/amtxur/shout_out_to_ubigtexan1492/,103,1549256288.0,"Sorry in advance for the long post but I just have to get this out there....


I'd be willing to bet the majority of you have had some sort of interaction with /u/BigTexan1492 at some point during your time here. 


I'd also be willing to bet a good number of you have had your life impacted by BigTex and he may even be the reason things finally clicked for you. He's a pillar of this community and a wonderful example of how great of an impact positivity and encouragement can go.

One month ago, he offered his services in the form of motivational emails. I get a lot of email and spend my work days in front of a computer so I'm often not very good at reading or responding to personal emails but his are short and sweet and often exactly what I need to hear that day. It's nice to have little periodic reminders of encouragement.

But then he did something a little different.

Last week, BigTex asked us for one thing we wanted to do this week that was new and/or special to us. I emailed him back that I had recently started biking and wanted to continue and that I also wanted to get into a bit of yoga. Of course he responded with wonderful words of encouragement. I asked him what *he* was going to do that was new and/or special to him and he said he'd let us know on Sunday.


Last night/this morning, BigTex sent out an email and posted a video about what he had done this week. 

**This dude did everything we all said we wanted to do throughout the week so we wouldn't be doing it alone.** 

Let that sink in a bit.


Maybe it doesn't seem like much, but to me it's incredible. I never expected this kind of support system or just how special it would be to me. The fact that some stranger on the Internet went out of their way to make other strangers feel a little less alone is... It's a little difficult to explain but it's incredibly empowering. Obviously, he wouldn't be able to do this all the time but the fact he did it even once, I feel less alone in this journey thanks to the support and generosity of BigTexan1492.


Thank you Brain.",1

Simple Starbucks Keto Guide - From A Barista,4646,8gmgkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/8gmgkj/simple_starbucks_keto_guide_from_a_barista/,560,1525337744.0,"As a Starbucks barista doing Keto, I've had to improvise a bunch during my time here! Here are some of the tips I've picked up along the way.

**Drinks**

Here are some of the drinks that I order

* Iced Tea w/ an Infusion and no Liquid Cane Sugar.
   * This is my go\-to order! In terms of teas, we have Black, Green, White, and Passion tea \(an herbal tea\).
   * We also have our infusions! In these guides, I always see the Iced tea mentioned but never the infusions. The infusions are really just herbal teas and they can completely change the flavor of your drink! We have Pineapple, Peach, and Strawberry \(some locations may vary\). You can combine and of them with the teas and it will likely turn out amazing! \(I personally haven't tried any of them with the passion tea\)
   * When ordering, just ask for your tea with the infusion and unsweetened. For Example, ""Venti Iced Green Tea with the Pineapple Infusion and unsweetened""
* Hot Teas and Coffee
   * Our hot teas and drip coffee come unsweetened by default. You can get whatever you want. You can also ask them to steam a little bit of heavy cream on top. Make sure to specify a little bit, otherwise they might make it a ""misto"" Which is half coffee/tea and half heavy cream.
* Iced Coffee/Cold Brew
   * There is a lot you can do with iced coffee and cold brew. Our Iced coffee get classic syrup by default, so be sure to specify that you want it ""unsweetened.""
   * We currently have two sugar free syrups, Cinnamon Dolce and Vanilla. I personally recommend the vanilla \(not a big fan of the cinnamon dolce\). We also have a ""skinny"" mocha. The skinny mocha is sugar free, but it is sweetened with sucralose, which can affect blood sugar levels, so it’s best to consume this in moderation. By the way, it can successfully kill a chocolate/mocha craving. :\)
   * If your are getting a sugar free syrup/skinny mocha, make sure to specify the number of pumps you want depending on the size. I recommend 2 for a tall, 3 for a grande, and 4 for a venti of sugar free syrups and 1 of skinny mocha in a tall/grande and 2 in a venti.
   * You can also ask for light Heavy Cream or light Almond Milk on top.
* Keto ""Pink Drink""
   * Now, let me start this by saying this taste absolutely NOTHING like our normal pink drink, so don't expect it to. Although it is a close color and tastes very intriguing. In order to order it, ask for this:
   * \[Tall,Grande,Venti\] Iced Passion Tea with No Liquid Cane Sugar, \[2,3,4\] pumps of sugar free vanilla and light heavy cream on top.
   * If you want it to look more like the Pink Drink, You can ask them to add the Freeze Dried strawberries to it.
* Keto Carmel Macchiato.
   * This drink will likely be higher in carbs than the previous options, coming in around 5\-6 grams of carbs. Also, I wouldn't recommend anything bigger than a grande. A grande would probably have 6\-8 grams of carbs in it, a tall would be around 3\-6. Also, the hot version will have more carbs than the iced version because there is more milk. Ask for it like this:
   * \[Tall,Grande\] Skinny Caramel Machiato with almond milk and no caramel drizzle.
   * if it fits your macros, you can ask for light caramel drizzle, which will add about 2\-3 carbs to your drink.
   * Our almond milk has 5 grams of carbs per cup. A tall iced will likely have about 5oz of almond milk while the hot will have around 10oz.
   * You can ask for heavy whipping cream \(around 7g of carbs per cup\) but it will also have over 800 calories for a cup. Additionally, you can go half heavy cream half almond milk if you'd like.
* Keto Mocha
   * This is a great option for those occasional Chocolate cravings. Half and Half steams a lot better than heavy cream, so if you can spare the carbs, go with ""breve"" over heavy cream \(it will also have significantly less carbs.
   * How I order it: Short mocha with three pumps of skinny mocha. Breve
   * You can adjust the pumps of mocha to your taste.
* Keto Doubleshot.
   * One of my go\-to drinks that I still enjoy every time. I love this drink. A venti doubleshot will have five shots of espresso shaken with ice in a shaker then topped off with 2&#37; milk. Simply substitute the 2&#37; with light heavy cream or almond milk! I like to flavor mine with sf vanilla, but play around with the recipe to find what you like!
   * How I order: Venti Starbucks Doubleshot on Ice Unsweetened with almond milk and sugar free vanilla.
* Keto Chai
   * This one I get only occasionally because im not positive of the amount of carbs in it, but it should be relatively low. Its just like our chai tea latte with little compromise \(not watery like the chai tea back\) I also usually get more pumps of the chai because I like the spice. here's how I order:
   * ""Grande Iced Lightly Sweet Chai Latte, NO liquid cane, 3 Splenda \(or sweetener of your choice\), breve.""
   * The sweetener is optional, bUt I think it adds a lot to the taste.

**Things to Eat:**

If you ever have to eat at Starbucks, im sorry! We don't have that many options. Here are some of my go\-tos though

* The inside of a panini! I usually get either the turkey pesto panni or the chicken and double smoked bacon and eat the insides of it. The turkey pesto is relatively filling if you combine it with a drink from above.
* Most Starbucks will have almonds, some sort of cheese, or a cheese and salami tray.
* The Egg and cheese protein box. leaving the fruit.
* The new meal sized BLT Turkey protein box. I leave the bread off.
* On occasion ill get the Bacon sous vide egg bites, but very rarely. I usually rub a pat of butter on them and eat them. Beware that they do have 9g of carbs for both \(11g from the egg white bites\)
* Edit: **Moon Cheese!:** These crunchy little cheese balls are amazing and are 100&#37; cheese! I eat these every time my store gets it in but we always sell out! It truly is a godsend when you miss that ""crunchy"" texture! Also great in salad and other foods

**General Tips:**

* If you think your Iced Tea is too watery, ask for no water! We usually put 50&#37; tea and 50&#37; water and then add ice! I personally never get water in my teas.
* If you want Splenda or another sweetener in your tea, ask the barista to shake it into the tea, it will usually taste better because it will be more dissolved/incorporated in.
* On that note, always make sure your tea is shaken! All us barista SHOULD shake the teas but sometimes we forget \(and some baristas don't at all\) but it definitely WILL make it better! Especially with the infusions.

**Things To Note:**

* Our Almond Milk only has 5g of carbs per 8 ounces, making it one of the lowest carb milk options we have.
   * Coconut milk has 8g per 8 ounces
   * Soy has 13g per 8 ounces
* Our Teas and Iced Coffee's come with syrup in the recipe, but we can remove it upon request!
* We have two sugar free syrups currently available: Vanilla and Cinnamon Dolce
* If you're feeling fancy, we can make you a pour\-over, which is where we brew a coffee fresh for you using the ""pour\-over"" method. You can choose any of our coffees \(some stores have more variety than others\)
* Our whipped cream is Heavy Cream and regular vanilla syrup, so it does have a good amount of carbs. However, it is fresh and delicious, so you can ask for just a little bit on top of your drink if it fits your macros.
* Your barista is willing to help you! Just be nice and let them know you cannot eat sugar and ask them for a suggestion!

**Things To Avoid:**

* Frappuccinos. It doesn't matter if you get it ""light"". The light base has 50&#37; less sugar than the regular one, but it still have enough sugar to knock you out of ketosis. While you can ask for any drink blended, They won't stick together and the liquid will separate from the blended ice.
* Refreshers: Bottom line, our refreshers have a lot sugar. making them not suitable for Keto.
* Stevia: Our stevia is mixed with fructose and has 2g of carbs per packet.
* Breakfast Sandwich ""Insides"": The eggs inside the breakfast sandwiches all have carbs due to the mixture used. This includes the wraps.
* Any regular syrup: This one is kind of self\-explanatory, But you'd be surprised how many people say they are low carb and ask for ""only three pumps"". On average, each pump of our regular syrups have 4\-6g of carbs.
* White Mocha: There is no skinny version of this.
* Matcha: Our matcha is a mix that comes pre\-sweetened.
* Chai: Our chai mix has a ton of carbs. Even the lightly sweet chai has carbs. However, our chai tea bags have no carbs.

Be sure to drop any questions in the comments! I'll try to answer them all! I hope your guys found this helpful. Ill try to update this as I remember more details. Additionally, please feel free to comment what you get at Starbucks, I can add it to this guide to help other users!

I started Keto After hearing how rogan speak of it and the weight was really coming off and I started exercising. Around 8 months later I was down 3 stone and a month away from starting IVF, but started craving carbs massively- did a test and I was pregnant. I was SO happy! I didn’t Keto when I was pregnant as cravings were so strong
Last  August I gave birth to my baby boy. I didn’t start back on Keto again until February this year. I’m now down over 4stone from my starting weight.
I had fainting and fitting episodes every 6 months or so since I had meningitis as a child and I haven’t had any since starting the diet. 

Side note - 2 weeks after discovering the pregnancy my husband ran off with someone else and wants nothing to do with our baby- this huge knock to my confidence and the chaos of being a single mum made my motivation to get back on it again low but I’m glad I did cause I feel so much better! I do my first 10k run next month in Manchester, uk!

I feel a ton better, the only thing is that I haven't noticed my weight drop yet. When I was eating g a healthy PBD when I first went vegan 2 years ago I dropped about 30 pounds in 3 months. Only difference is that I probably ate collard greens every day for three months straight, and lost do them. contributing to that weight loss. Right now I eatorw fruits and not as many greens. I would like to include greens for dinner and I put them in my morning smoothie. I'll make my list:

Every morning I make a smoothie:
Almond Milk
2 bannanas
2 tbsp of flax seed
1 cup of spinach
1 tbsp Coco powder
1 heaping scoop of Peanut butter(just ground up peanuts)

Lunch usually consists of various fryitsm. Usually half a watermelon, a peach, and 2 berries and sometimes an extra peach or apple 

Dinner
This is where I struggle the most. Usually for dinner I will eat whatever my mom has made for me, usually pretty healthy, if not then I make myself rice or get some more fruit. It really varies every day.

I had this whole body inflammation for about 10 years or so (From the age of 17 ? I think.. Well I'm 27 now), later at about (22yo) I was diagnosed with debilitating chronic fatique and generalised anxiety disorder, tried antidepressants, helped only short term..also couple years later (late 25yo) diagnosed with unclear reactive arthritis, tendonitis, bursitis.. I made tests for everything.. I did try to fix things with typical western medicine, completely trying to put my trust and effort into that.. (Also from 25yo till this February I was pescetarian, gluten free, then later on I tried introducing meat, but still ate lots of carbs.. felt no big change) So..more than a year passed, which didn't resolve anything and the arthritis symptoms got really bad.. had to stop doing many activities that I like, social interacting, sports, had to drop my day job, masters degree and blahblah.. Was prescribed with more medication, which only helped a bit short term.. then I destroyed my stomache with NSAIDs, got an ulcer, hiatal hernia, severe GERD.. No worries.. We have other drugs for that, which only masked the symptoms, but never cured the cause.. Change diet a bit, fixed my stomach a bit, but everything at the most part stayed the same.. I lost hope, lost trust for most of doctors.. (though I'm not saying there aren't any good ones !) I do understand that the body is really complex machine, I felt that I'm incompetent to even try to attempt understanding it.. I started to feel like a real burden for doctors as I felt that most people with chronic illnesses are too big and long of a project for most doctors to work on, so I felt as if the easiest way for them is to mute the symptoms with medication.. which is also great for the economy... But I couldn't give up on myself.. While still going to the doctors I started to look for ways on the wide internet, lol.. Tried many things, like whm, meditation, streching, stopped drinking alcohol. Then I took this IgG intolerence test, which is deemed as a complete bullshit of a test, most doctors say that it doesn't show your intolerance to foods, but more likely what you ate recently..:) but It did left me wonder - "" hmm maybe I should go deeper into the diet field again ? "" Surprisingly I dropped dairy and other inflammatory foods like nightshades and peanut butter, that it shown on the chart and those my gastroenterologist recommended me.. like those nightshades.. Well to my surprise it made me feel a bit better.. I could even start to do some sports again.. But I still I don't know why, ocassionaly about 2-3 times a week I had really bad joint pain flare ups.. And bold, dull and numb ongoing arthritis pain...I felt so lost, for fuck sake.. Later my girlfriend suggested to look into Michaela Petersons carnivore diet..I was sceptical, but still out of respect for Michaela's father famous Jordan, I tried.. Eating only meat was too hard and depressing for me.. But still I tried it for a week, felt actually better, had not got any arthritis flareups for a week, look into why could it work.. Luckily at the same time I got an appointment to meet a physiotherapy doctor.. Who with a smile on his face recommended me to try low carb diet.. (not more than 100g carbs a day, then 90,80,70) And It reduced my flareups.. Then I found out that he himself is on so called KETO diet.. I was like, I heard of that, but didn't really think of it as of something game changin'.. Two weeks ago I started egg, dairy free KETO.. found Doctor Berry's channel and for two weeks I didn't had any joint flareups, first days on that (5/70/25 CFP ratio) was hard, had insomnia, sugar cravings, even diarrhea.. I hate to eat meat for many ethical reasons and I wish I could not, but for now even my brainfog, mood is getting better, even my arthritis morning numbness and ongoing day to day joint pain is getting so much better...So well...so far so good, looking towards the future!

Am I really the only person who thinks skinner people ARE sexier than fatter people? I know its quite common to promote the ""Be happy with your body"" and all that jazz, but I wish people would be more honest with themselves. 

I am convinced that deep down, people really do want to be treated like ""sexy"" people are, and find a partner that is just as ""sexy"". This ""she was sexy beforehand"" attitude is just unconvincing. It seems like the ""being content with your body"" is just a coping mechanism.

Skinny models sell products (magazines, food, cars, anything...) because thats what people are drawn towards. Doesn't the fact that marketing with skinny people actually sells stuff to the masses prove this point?

"Slower, less effective wound healing",3,hzt7xi,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/hzt7xi/slower_less_effective_wound_healing/,8,1596021804.0,"Hi everyone. I’m wondering if anyone who has been on this diet has ever experienced delayed wound healing. I am someone who breaks out frequently, and I’ve noticed over the course of a year that my skin does not heal/recover as well as it used to and I’m often left with scars. I cannot stress enough that I am not blaming the diet, obviously it could be attributed to other changes in my life or that I am getting older. I am simply looking to see if any others had experienced this and if they took any action to remedy it. 

I eat a lot of legumes (different types of beans and lentils) and grains, mostly rice and occasionally quinoa. I incorporate fruits and vegetables into my meals and also eat oatmeal on a daily basis.

The reason why this is such a big deal is because my Dad suffers from a slew of health issues, most of them being cardiovascular & preventable/controllable. He has high cholesterol and is at-risk of heart attack. He eats A LOT of meat and cheese, specifically dark meats like beef, lamb & goat.  He’s a reasonable but skeptical person, but I sat down with him and gave him objective scientific information on how his meat/dairy and processed food intake exacerbates his health problems and makes him even MORE susceptible to heart disease and heart attack. After about 2 months of deliberation and him tasting my plant based cooking, he promised me to switch!!! I know that this is true and no just lip service because he emptied out all the meat/dairy in our fridge and gave the unopened stuff to our neighbors (they’re extremely close to us lol it’s not weird) and the opened stuff he threw out. It’s so exciting and heartwarming for him to do this and take initiative for his health. He watched me, my sister and my mom all become plant-based and he’s gonna join us!!!

I started keto the day after Halloween 2017, so it'll be one year after this month. I started keto because I'd previously had mild success with Paleo and an online friend of mine went from tall and flabby to  super-ripped-holy-shit in less than a year with keto. I was a 31 year old, 5'5"", 215lb woman desperately trying to shed the baby weight I gained...in 2009. This morning I weighed myself and saw a number I haven't seen since 2004, my senior year of high school: 135. 


I screamed like a little girl because I never thought I'd accomplish this in *less than a year.* Holy shit, people! ELEVEN MONTHS!! From size 16 pants to 6. From XL shirts to small. Wow. 

Keto came easy to me as a lover of all things creamy and cheesy and veggie-laden; I took to it right away. I made mistakes along the way (AHEMELECTROLYTESAHEM), but never fell off the wagon. I went to weddings and parties and holiday gatherings (and had sweets constantly pushed on me because I'm a high school teacher and apparently we have FEED ME SUGAR tattooed on our foreheads) and politely declined every non-keto food that was offered to me. And you know what? It was not difficult.  I have no desire to cheat because not only have I been shedding pounds like it's going out of style, but I *genuinely love all the food I eat.* Keto fucking rules. 

(And so does IF...OMAD helped me shed these last 4 stubborn pounds, and 18:6 kept my skin tight after losing so much so quickly. Shout out to r/intermittentfasting!)

I learned a lot about myself along the way. A few weeks ago I took the time to calculate my daily caloric intake pre-keto: I was consuming well over 2,000 calories, mostly carbs. I eat 1200-1300 now, so this realization made my stomach turn. My relationship with food has evolved from cosmic-level destructive to something beautiful that I can be proud of. It doesn't control me anymore. I'm free, and I'm loving it. 

I really don't think I would've been as wildly successful without this sub. I've learned so much here, you've all been insanely helpful and kind and supportive, and you've answered so many of the questions I've had along the way. I never thought I'd say this, but THANK YOU, REDDIT! 

I'm never going to stop eating keto. I sleep better, I have energy all the time, my mood and attitude have improved, I'm brimming with confidence in myself because I feel more attractive than I ever have in my life...hell, even my dentist said my teeth are healthier. Then he lectured me about the dangers of keto after I told him why, and I laughed. People are ignorant, and we should all brush them off (pun intended) because we know what we are doing: working our asses off to make our lives better. 

Thank you for reading if you've gotten this far, and again, seriously, *thank you.* 

Also, RIP my favorite sweatshirt. 😥 You'll always be around for cold lounging-around-the-house days!

After 22 days of no cheat keto,i cheated,and i cheated big time.
I can not understand that whenever i feel in a bad sad mood that i try to make me feel better by stuffing my face with crisps.

Is it because i was stuck at -+138 kilo for a whole week?
Is it because a friend who i kinda liked told me something that i dont like.
I have no idea.
The fact that i go to the store at 23h in the evening for 2 bags of crisps disgust me.
How can i ever become a better person,if with every little setback i take,start eating like a pig.
The crisps are not even that good,i did not like the texture anymore.
Now i feel bloated,ashamed,and more importantly mad at myself.

I found a lot of relief recently in cutting sugar and caffeine for 1 year and I’m looking to optimize my diet to increase my mental clarity, decrease pain, and increase energy.

I switched 2 weeks ago to PBD. I considered my diet prior to switching pretty healthy, lean protein + veggies was a standard meal and minimal dairy, minimal wheat products.

Typical day then:

Breakfast: 1.5 cups oats + 1 egg

Lunch: 2 cups bean chili

Dinner: Salmon burger or Beyond burger + 3 cups roasted broccoli

Snacks: Peanuts, Apple, Celery with Hummus

Supplements: vitamin D, iron daily

Since switching to plant based I was hoping for increased energy but I’ve been so sleepy, including having to take naps 2-3x/day because I just feel so exhausted. I have found that my chronic pain has decreased somewhat, and breathing is easier, but at what cost?!?!

Typical day now:

Breakfast: 1.5 cup oats + 1 T flax

Lunch: Kale salad with tomato and carrot with vinegar + 2 cups chickpeas + 1/4 avocado, 1 cup collard greens

Dinner: 1 cup brown rice + 1 cup bean mix + crushed tomato topping

Snacks: banana, apple, blueberries, handful of peanuts, raw tomato

Supplements: 1000 B12 2x/wk, Vit D daily, iron 3x/wk

So, I hit my one-year keto anniversary, I am supposed to make a post, right? This time last year I hit the heaviest I have ever been. 270lbs. Felt the worst I ever did. Every day was a struggle for me. Just like most, I flirted with the idea of Keto before, but never stuck to it for any length of time. I thought it was impossible. I thought I let myself go too far and could never recover from it. I just thought I was going to have to live this way for the rest of my life. In comes a few friends who want to try Keto and ask if I want to join. I grudgingly agree but with little faith of actually sticking with it for any reasonable amount of time. I knew the basics… and followed them for a while. I started to see the scale lower and was excited with the first couple weeks, as everyone knows, you drop quite a bit of weight at this time. As the summer went on, I started to get more into it… Still nothing serious. I would consider it lazy keto, not tracking anything but just sticking to low carb/zero sugar. Would chow down on chicken wings 3-4 times a week (a staple for me) and the rest some kind of chicken breast or red meat.
  

By August, I was down to about 240lbs. I had a cruise planned with my wife for October so I started to feel good about my progress and now I had something to fight for. I wanted to look good for our cruise and finally feel confident enough to lay on the beach and not worry about what others think! In comes September. A really trying time for me. I find out my wife has been unfaithful and we separate. I am absolutely devastated by this. I attribute keto for my mental clarity and pulling me through this toughest part of my life so far. I never once stopped with my keto diet. It was hard, again, the hardest thing I have ever been through and I felt like at least this is a process I can control. Luckily, I have pretty decent friends and I still went on the cruise with a friend.


 I left for vacation around 210-215lbs. We had a blast. So much fun! This was the first time I stopped keto since I started on July 1st. My first “cheat day” (more like cheat week). Once we got back from vacation, it was back to the real world. I thought to myself, “I need to keep going”. I have to continue my weight loss journey and continue to just feel good. So, I continue on, not really keep track of anything and still losing a bit of weight here and there. 

Next comes Thanksgiving… I ate mostly keto-friendly food; my carb count might have climbed up enough to kick me out of ketosis but I weathered the storm far better than I thought I would. By December I have reached close to my goal, to be under 200 pounds. I was at 205lbs. I missed my goal, just by 5 pounds! That’s it! 65 total pounds!!! I was super excited. At this point I thought to myself, I have been doing this for so long now, it is time to start getting serious. (By now, all my friends stopped doing keto… They dropped out one at a time, most stopping back in October/November.) 


I told myself, let's go a year. So, in January, I finally start deep diving into what my macros should be and how to maximize my weight loss. I figured all of that stuff out. I still don’t keep total track and just eat with it in mind. I hover around between 200-190 for a while. It feels like I can’t lose anymore. I start to get worried. Did I hit the dreaded plateau I read about on here??? Have I stalled? What is wrong? So, after reading about other people freaking out about the same type of situation, I realize, I am not keeping as close track of what I am eating as I think and I need to buckle down and Keep Calm and Keto On.


 At this point, I have a new goal. I want to lose 100lbs. within the year. I want to be down to 170lbs. How crazy is that! I see people losing that much on here, but I never thought I could be one of them. I thought I was just some fat shlub who doesn’t have what it takes to get under 200lbs. let alone down to 170… Boy was I wrong. Anyone can do this. Everyone will have their own personal journey, but anyone can do it. 


I created a meal plan based on my macros. For the first time, I am telling myself I can only eat this stuff. Nothing else. Without everything else I went through, I would not have had enough willpower/discipline to stick with it. But I felt determined! Day in and day out, I ate the same thing… eggs for lunch… scrambled, fried, sunny side up… I got really good at making eggs. Different topping, cheese, sometimes salsa… hot sauce… anyway you can eat eggs… I have done it. For dinner, chicken thighs everywhere. Always chicken thighs (The occasional steak too). I have a million different spices and rubs now to go along with the chicken. Any flavor baked chicken, I have done that too. Mostly baked buffalo chicken thighs have replaced my chicken wing obsession.


 So, after a bit of this, I start to lose more weight. Slowly, but surely, I am making progress. I might have slipped for a day, in March (it was my birthday, give me a break) but it was right back on the horse after that. (What helped me was reminding myself, a cheat meal won’t kill you. But do not rationalize with yourself about it. What I mean by this is, don’t tell yourself, just because you had one cheat meal, let's make it a cheat day. Oh, I had a cheat day, let's make it a cheat weekend. DON’T DO IT. It isn’t worth it. The short-lived gratification you get from those sweets and carbs are not worth the longer-term crappy feeling you will get!!! Getting over that was very hard. I’m not going to lie. It was an addiction. BUT, if me, some random normal guy can overcome it, SO CAN YOU. I BELIEVE IN YOU!!!) 


Now May rolls around. Just two months left until my goal! I am sitting at around 180lbs. I can’t believe it. I am still just in shock over my transformation. Now I am thinking “everything is still so loose”. My belly skin is loose and droopy, my arms are still jiggly (however, less batwing-like!!!  Anyone who has lifted their arms and waved or any form of movement for whatever reason know exactly what I am talking about here… not flattering.) 


 To combat this, I am going to try and start working out! I have always hated working out. As it turns out… I didn’t hate the way working out made me feel or hate the process of working out… I hated how I felt all the time and working out just made me realize that! I contemplated what type of workout I wanted to do. Swimming? Running? Weightlifting? Get a gym membership? Stay at home with some type of equipment?  I ended up buying a cheap rowing machine for the house. I start rowing. I read how great of an exercise and how low impact it is on your body. “it uses 85% of your bodies muscles” is what I kept seeing everywhere… So, I bought into the hype.


 I started watching YouTube videos and started practicing my form on the machine and how to properly do it. (This is important!!! I want to give a shout out to Dark Horse Rowing (YouTube channel).) Once I got the hang of it, I noticed I do not feel nearly as bad as I used to from working out! I actually feel fantastic and want to do more!! I can actually do this! I can reach my goal. I am not going to miss my goal this time. I am determined. So, for the month of June, I set a goal of 50 miles by July1st. I row and row and row. I just keep going. I set goals for my rowing time. I just want to keep getting better. I have never felt this type of drive before. I am motivated. I am motivated by…me! I motivated myself! It took everything I went through, my entire journey to see it, but I am a badass motherfucker who can do anything I set my mind or heart to. I have never felt this type of confidence before. 


Well, here we are on July 1. 50 Rowing miles and one year later. 365 days. I am currently sitting at 172 pounds. I was at 170, but the added workout has sent me up past it and this is okay! 170 was just a number. I look and feel a million times better than I thought ever possible. I wanted to share this because I know some people on here feel how I felt when I started. You feel overwhelmed like you can’t take control of your life. But you can. You absolutely can. Nothing is stopping you. I promise you, if you stay true to yourself and stick with it, no matter what it is. You will be better for it. You will have rough times and happy times. That is part of the journey. You don’t have to be perfect. No one is perfect. Just try to be better for you. When people say it is a lifestyle transformation, it truly is. But you need to buy into it to reap the benefits. You need to buy into yourself.

Since starting Keto back in May, I've lost nearly 57lbs. Some days are definitely easier than others, for sure. In the past month, my weight loss has slowed, but the inches continue to go. I'm down almost 9"" in my waist. So.. hooray there.

There are a whole bunch of people here, including me, who got to they state they started out at, buy consistently allowing themselves to step outside of whatever they had promised themselves they would do. We cheated ourselves all the time.

""I had a rotten day - I'll eat a bag of chips"" ""I can have a meal deal at McDonalds.... or two"". ""Just one more slice of cake, or pie, or whatever."" etc. etc. etc.

When I come here to /r/keto I come to learn, to be inspired, to share in other's success and offer my congratulations - and then I imagine when I hit that point and it keeps me going. You may some metabolic miracle. You may not. I really don't care. If you cheated, that was your choice. Don't inflict it on the rest of us. **One thought that I don't need in my head, is the possibility that maybe I could do that too.** I can't believe I'm alone in this. 

So, please, follow the posting rules. Have a success? Post it. Got some pics. Post them. Find an awesome new recipe. Bring it. Having an issue? Ask for help. But you cheated? Keep it to yourself.

I'm going for a low fat, WFPB lifestyle for health and to lose some weight. As I understand it, I want to avoid saturated fats (such as oils).  I understand that good fats are needed too.

My question is about dried fruits... In my mind, they're basically sugar, with some fiber. Is there any problem to having these in moderation with my oats in the morning?

Also, how are things like Olives? Do I need to be careful with these?

Is there something else I need to be wary of regarding the Low (bad) Fat part of my diet?

I ask about the dried fruits, because getting fresh fruit (especially during this pandemic) is quite hard because I live in the Philippines.

I ummed and aaahhed about it for ages and decided not to do it. 

The universe had other plans for me.

I’ve now been recently diagnosed with gout in my knee, and my doctor has told me that I now have to follow a plant based diet because otherwise I will be constantly having attacks of gout, and it’s owie. My manger at work is Vegan and she’s been kind enough to tell me places of where to get the best meat free stuff and dairy free stuff. What I’m currently stuck on is snacks.

If I had to make a guess, I was probably eating around 1800 roughly a day, and I’m pretty sure I’ve gone to a little over half of that now. I’m not doing too bad with main meals (although finding recipes I like the look of is difficult). My biggest trouble is finding snacks that are going to fill me up for the day as the lesser calories makes me hungry all day. I’m banned from sugar so I’m going through a sugar withdrawal, and fruit isn’t cutting it. If anyone has any good snack ideas that fill you up, I would be grateful. 

To help, I’ll list the things I can’t have or they’ll trigger a gout attack: 

Red meat
Pork
Lamb 
Processed foods 
Seafood (shellfish, haddock, tuna) 
Alcohol 
Refined sugar (cakes, sweets etc)
Refined carbohydrates (white bread, white rice)

I have lost about 15lbs with my diet changes so far, but I don’t keep strict track of that either. I just try to go by how different foods make me feel so I can improve my relationship with food during this transition. However, I did have a little surprise at the doctor today. 

So, I have seasonal allergies, and apparently pollen season is early this year in Louisiana. I woke up full blown sick with sinus pressure, congestion, pain. The whole 9. 

I dragged myself to urgent care to get my usual (steroid shot, antibiotics, steroid pack). They always take my blood pressure before I go in to see the doctor.  

The nurse has to use the biggest blood pressure cuff on my arm because the “normal” sized adult one is just a bit too small. Also, they normally can’t get my blood pressure on the first try on my upper arm, and they’ve even had to resort to taking it on my fore arm in the past. 

Today was different! She still had to use the biggest cuff, but my blood pressure was taken on the first try, and it had gone down since the last time I was sick (which was just two months ago because I’m allergic to the air).

i work in the restaurant industry.  we're at the peak of the season and we regularly work 10-13 hour shifts.  

i have no problems resisting to the temptation of every awesome tricks of the trade (being around fresh warm bread, pasta, etc...) but i used to be like my coworkers and turn towards sweets for a quick energy boost.  

so recently, i made a delicious recipe for fat bombs and i keep myself a little stash in the staff fridge.  nothing complicated mind you..  it's just coconut oil, cocoa powder, a little bit of stevia, and roasted crushed almonds. i just pop one in when i feel my energy going low.  i never eat more than 2 during those long hours, usually just one, and it keeps hunger and fatigue at bay.

I keep them in a ziplock box and it's clearly labeled ""'my name' do not eat. dangerous""

now, everybody knows i'm on 'that weird diet' by now since i kept having questions about my weight loss.  i keep it vague, (you know,..  i stopped drinking beer and i eat better...)

now..  this happened last week-end.  it started raining and i was working the patio section so guess who's got to go home early??

fast forward to tuesday.  one of my colleagues is pissed at me.  

""what the hell u/yupynut ??  i ate some of your candy and i've been sick for the past 24 hours!!""

now i'm thinking it can't be me, i haven'T brought candies to the restaurant for the past 2 months..  he says : ""those chocolates you keep in the fridge...""   i'm thinking oh-oh...

-""those are not chocolates..  they're like energy bars..  how many did you eat?

brace yourselves...  he answers :"" i don'T know...  8 or 10""

that amounts to 3/4 cup of pure coconut oil.........

so i was in the boss's office today with him to explain the situation.

my boss's reaction? :  

-""you know u/yupynut is on this crazy weird diet and eats weird stuff.. (i'm also known for bringing hard boiled eggs and keeping a bottle of ketorade) you should have known better than to eat some of his stuff..  also if this ever happens again i'm giving you a blame for stealing other employees lunches.""

at the same time i asked my boss for some large shirts (we need to buy company themed shirts to work) because i'm now floating in my XL ones.

moral of the story...  when at work,  keep your stuff labeled with warnings... and if someone tries stealing, i guess they'll be caught 'brown handed'...

Starch Solution: I must be doing it wrong.,6,hva66y,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/hva66y/starch_solution_i_must_be_doing_it_wrong/,21,1595376655.0,"Hey guys, 

Two year since I got type 2 Diabetes. On 1gm Metformin and Diovan for Blood Pressure. My weights 75 kilos and I’m 5ft5. 

So I have started losing weight but since the starch solution started ok beginning to lose more slowly than usual. 

Also, my two hour post meals are seeing heavy spikes to around 202. It comes down to normal levels in 3 hours like 122. 

I’m fasting 15 hours and pre meal levels for BG are around 115. 

I take my metformin with food because it’s the only way my stomach will tolerate it. 

My meals are a cup of cooked white rice, lentils and potato mash, about a cup and chickpea salad consisting of tomatoes, onions, coriander leaf. Salt. Pepper. Spices. 

No oil in anything. 

I’m told this shouldn’t be raising my levels but it is. What am I doing wrong here? I’m going to cut rice to see if there’s a difference in result and vice versa without the potatoes. 

I’m so scared from eating after this that I’m not having more food at all, like veggies, fruits etc and I eat my meal by 7pm and so I’m mostly hungry by nighttime again. 

Anyone else here have any feedback regarding this particular diet?

UPDATE: Cutting out rice bumped post meal numbers down to around the 130s post meal and then recovery by 3 hours to 115 and fasting for 12-14 hours yielded to around 107 which is the best fasting number I have seen in years. 

I suppose I’m in an adaption period and my body, I think reacts badly to rice period. 

Ok will keep updating numbers here occasionally.

Fat 28 y/o female. 5’8” For some reason I deleted my original post? Sometimes I get weird about the internet and mass delete shit. ANYWAYS. I started an instagram of everything I ate every day that a lot of you guys followed and gave great advice. I fell off of the Instagram posts once I got the hang of my new diet/lifestyle. 

I haven’t consistently counted calories (I’ve just checked in every once in a while if I was unsure) and really haven’t been working out hardcore.I just focus on getting the daily dozen and eating a variety of foods. 

It has blown my fucking mind that i am almost always full, and I no longer struggle with feeling “starving” on a “diet”. (Newsflash former self.... you were fiber deficient!!!)

My inflammation is WAY down and I perform so much better at my physically demanding job without going home with aches and pains. Since I feel better, I’ve been moving more and my resting heart rate average is 65! That’s pretty damn good for a morbidly obese person. Before it was in the 90s and above. 

I OFFICIALLY NO LONGER HAVE PCOS AND AM NO LONGER PRE-DIABETIC. This is the best part! I used to have to take a ton of metformin every morning which made me feel like shit at the start of every day. No more! My doctor took me off of it and told me to keep doing what I’m doing, and that she is proud of me. :)  The only medication I still take is 10mg of Lisinopril for blood pressure. (Down from 20mg) I look forward to saying goodbye to that as well in 2020. 

I know I have farther to go than what is behind me. I am still morbidly obese, but I feel really confident and strong. I know that if I keep going, I will only see positive results. 

My goal in 2020 is to work out more and get 45-90 min of exercise a day, per Dr. Greger. I’m looking forward to reading “how not to diet” and implementing his “21 tweaks”. I’m already seeing positive results from the tweaks.  My goal is to lose an average of 1.5lbs a week, and end the year at 250. That is what I weighed in high school my 10th year when I first started tracking my weight regularly.

Thank you all for being supportive, uplifting, and informative. I am eternally grateful, you have no idea.

I'm planning on literally doing only fat as opposed to adding minor amounts of other nutrition with the exception of coffee/tea.  I plan to have nothing but bulletproof coffee, mct oil in my tea and repeating the tea with maybe olive oil if I feel hungry.

State why I should take up the Keto diet over others given my three auto immune disorders.

I've recently discovered the ZC and Keto subreddits and wanted to pick your brains, if you don't mind.

Firstly, I'm in my early thirties, 95kg/209lb, 1.98m/6'6 and live in New Zealand, where public healthcare is GREAT! I am also a US citizen, so I really feel for you guys.

I was diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis at around age 19, after 7 years of ""growing pains"" it was a strange relief to have a diagnosis. Pretty soon afterward I developed Iritis and Ulcerative Colitis. 
Most of my life I've left my ""ADHD"" unmedicated, as the heavy stimulant versions were too easy for me to abuse given my nature at the time, in addition, my mother did not trust that Ritalin wouldn't alter my cheery disposition (I was a happy kid) I'll never know whether this was a good choice but that's not the point right now.

Recently I've started taking Strattera, which is non-stimulant ADHD medication, and it's changed my life. I can think logically with thoughts in order of importance, and am no longer swayed by strange internal bias or taken with wandering uncontrollable mental imagery.

I'd been pretty gung ho about my AS and UC until a few months ago, with the help of this medication and a few scary flares, including being stretchered from a plane to a waiting ambulance at landing, (pancolitis) I've finally started to see the cause and effect between my diet and physical activity and my health. 
Diet wise, I've always eaten what I wanted, but that's all changing now. Gluten, Lactose and Yeast have never agreed with me, and trigger flares, stress also seems to be a huge factor in flaring, as most of mine happen around highly stressful life events. 

I'm a firm believer that most of my symptoms can be controlled or eliminated through a combination of diet, exercise and willpower/mindset growth, and have approached both the Keto and ZC communities on reddit to gain some real world tested knowledge about which path I should take, as these two seem to be the ones for auto immune disorders such as mine Thanks for your time, and I look forward to reading your input. Cheers!

One more thing, you guys are great, I love the quest for knowledge and you seem to be on a similar quest and I'm so glad these communities exist.

This has made a significant difference in my hydration by the end of the day and it feels like I am not actually drinking a lot of water.

People always say “you must be so proud” and “you must feel so much happier/healthier/etc.” but honestly I just feel like me with less boob which is a loss I’m very upset about lol. I’m not proud of myself because I honestly feel like getting here was so easy once I found Keto. I spent my whole life trying to lose weight (for health reasons mostly bc being fat didn’t really bother me much) and once I started Keto, things just happened. Anyway, if you’re starting, stick with it. Take pics, measurements, etc. Have goal outfits. Have a “Keto buddy”. I couldn’t do this without my hubby who cooks all of our delicious Keto meals. I’m a lucky lady! But if I can do this, so can you. I am 100% “cheat free”, no cravings, never feeling hungry. I love what I eat and I don’t plan to ever eat any other way.

Neither will this change.

I am not doing Keto for other people, and other people are not doing Keto for me. 

Keto for me has been a very drastic and convincing lifestyle for me that nothing is getting in my way from being healthy, in shape, and kicking ass in life. This should be the same for everyone else who has been on Keto and has seen results. You know it works, stick to it.

I hate to see people fall of the wagon because some people on the internet are arguing with each other. That is a pretty weak excuse - you arent going to make anyone guilty because you used them as an excuse to stay fat, you also arent proving any points, you're only hurting yourself. There are still people like me and many others who want to help you get fit and be healthy.

I will not be joining other Keto subreddits simply because it doesn't mean anything to me. This is my home and this is where I am staying.

Story Time... Meat Lover Tries Plant-Based,594,e62sy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/e62sy3/story_time_meat_lover_tries_plantbased/,160,1575510281.0,"My coworker has been on a plant-based diet for years. She would tell me all the time how great she feels having cut meat out of her diet, along with various other things like oil and cheese.

I humored her by acting amazed, but I actually thought she was full of shit.

About a month ago, she showed me this documentary called Game Changers (Netflix), and, after watching, I thought to myself _fine. I’ll try it for a week so I can prove her wrong and rub it in her face._

I didn’t eat meat for a week, avoided oil, cheese, and anything dairy really. Tried a lot of new vegetables for kicks. Not once during that week did I have a stomach ache, not once did I have diarrhea, not once did I fall asleep in my chair after lunch, not once did I wake up in the morning with hiccups and a burning feeling in my esophagus, nor did I even wake up feeling, well, _tired._

I now fully believe that humans were meant to live off fruits and vegetables. Me, a meat lover, something I couldn’t go a day without. It seems that the eating of meat has only been glorified by the media; in reality our ancestors only ate meat in dire circumstances.

It’s mind blowing to me how great I feel now. I thought I had a number of issues including IBS; I hadn’t had a day in **years** where my stomach didn’t ache after a meal, or where my heart didn’t race, or where I didn’t have to worry about blowing up the company bathroom 3 times a day. I had huge issues with tonsil stones and bad breath, now I haven’t had these issues all month, in fact it’s rare for me to even feel gunk on my teeth.

I feel like I’ve witnessed a miracle. If the me two months ago would have read what I’ve just written, she would have laughed and told me it’s all a placebo effect and that _I’m_ the one being brainwashed.

If only I’d known how wrong I was earlier.

It’s only been one month.

I’ve taken back control of my life in _one month._",0

I was about 260+ lbs two years ago, before I went plant based. You guys helped two weeks ago, but I'm also struggling with another problem that is extreme hunger all the time.

I looked back using myfitnesspal and it seems like I only lost 20 lbs this year. Last year I could eat 1,200 calories and feel fine. But, now it like if I don't eat 2,000 calories it feels horrible. I used to have to force myself to eat vegetables. Now it like I have 300 grams of broccoli, 100 grams of watercress + wrap and I'm hungry an hour later.

So it like the worst of both worlds, I'm not losing weight that much about 1 lbs every two weeks, but I'm extremely hungry.

I started to increase my vegetable consumption even more, but it seems to not do that much.

What can you eat to stop hunger?

I think my set point is 176 lbs, which is overweight for my height + muscle mass.

Note, I do exercise quite a bit, 30 miles of jogging + 4x a week of lifting. So my activity is sort of maxed out. Maybe, I can increase jogging to 40-50 miles a week.

I just find it insane that my BMI of 24.5, but hunger is extreme. Especially a year ago I could lose 2 lbs a week and I didn't really eat that much vegetables, mostly fruit, beans, grains + vegan protein foods. Maybe my ghrelin is messed up or something.",0

For the first year I did no exercise at all. Then started walking. Now I do a 5km walk 4days a week before work, and a nerd fit body workout twice a week for toning and building muscles.

I don't take any supplements and until the last 2ish months, I never really had any significant digestive issues. I pooped at a pretty normal 1-3 times a day for someone on a vegan diet and the contents of each were fairly unremarkable. That is to say, there were no notable, consistent issues. Then, with no change to my diet or lifestyle, I've started having very frequent bowel movements (at least twice the frequency of before), and each is rather loose, coming in the form of small pieces that are rather wet and fall apart in the toilet bowl. After I wipe and return to whatever activity, I often still feel like I didn't quite empty the tank and will usually find myself back on the toilet within 1-2 hours. Fortunately I'm not currently working so this is no big issue as it stands, but I am in the process of finding work and this could prove to be rather disruptive. Like I said earlier, this has been the case for about 2 months now, though I'm unsure when exactly it started and it just kind of came out of nowhere.

In February, I decided to finally change my eating habits and start keto. I tried doing strict keto for a while, but I found myself constantly breaking or craving that one cookie or potato or beer. In March, I decided I actually wanted something sustainable long term, and I began the laziest form of keto known to man. I pretty much don't count carbs, but I've educated myself on what has carbs and I avoid sugars and starches. I've seen it referred to as ""Christmas Keto"" around here - just a lot of meat and all the greens I want. I still do tomato sauces, ketchup, wine, and a few other not-great-for-keto things, but I've found that I'm finally happy with my eating habits and I think I can keep this up long term. Additionally, for birthdays/weddings/celebrations/grandmas I eat a slice of cake and whatever else I *want* to eat, because people show love through food and I love being loved. I only ever eat something when I want it now, which is new.

This year has been extremely stressful for me: I graduated law school and took the bar exam. Through this year, I've occasionally found that my favorite shirt no longer fit me, which has resulted in mixed feelings of joy, pride, and irritation because I often have nothing else clean. Today, however, I'm super happy and super pissed. 

I'm going to be a lawyer. Last summer, I spent $1,200 on two nice tailored suits, plus a whole bunch more on dress shirts. I have a wedding coming up in a few weeks and I was deciding what to wear, so I tried on my suit. It doesn't fit me. At all. It looks like I'm some gangly teenager wearing my dad's suit to his first date. This isn't a tailorable fix. I really couldn't believe it when I put my suit on. I asked a friend if I was imagining it, and she said I couldn't wear it under any circumstances. I'm honestly stunned, because this has been so easy for me and I never noticed. 

My starting weight was 230, and my current weight is 199. I still have fifteen to go. I know 31 lbs in five months isn't near as impressive as some of you folks, but I haven't been in onederland since high school and this has been nearly painless. It's been fourteen years since I was this size. I'm getting emotional just writing this. Freud said that the ego starts with the body, and for the first time in a decade and a half I'm feeling confident and like myself again. 

So thanks. Thank all of you. I've only ever lurked here, but I've been watching you all for a long time. Without this community, I wouldn't be where I am. You assholes cost me $1,200, but it is well worth it.

Sugar Singlehandedly Made Us Fat?,18,e6xlxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/e6xlxd/sugar_singlehandedly_made_us_fat/,9,1575660737.0,"I'm repeatedly told these days sugar made people fat, transitioning to sugar-laden ""fat-free"" products during the anti-fat craze made people fat, and somehow that segways into an all-around attack on carbs... so let's take a short look at what actually changed in diet numerically.

I'm choosing 1980 as baseline because this is claimed by some as the [beginning of our obesity epidemic](http://ehsmanager.blogspot.com/2015/08/watch-startling-evolution-of-american.html) although Americans have been trending upwards BMI for much longer going but it makes little difference imo.  

* https://ourworldindata.org/diet-compositions

1. 1980:  3178 avg calorie intake.  
1,631 (51.3%) calories by carbohydrates.  
1154 (36.3%) cal by fat.  

2. 2013:  3,682 avg calorie intake.  +504 calorie increase.  
    1,790 (48.6%) calories by carbohydrates. -2.7% of diet composition.  +159 calorie increase.  
    1,454 (39.4%) calories by fat.  +3.1% of diet composition.  +300 calorie increase.

Almost 2 to 1 increase of fat over carbohydrates.  Interesting.  Protein intake increased by about 45 calories.

Now scroll down to the composition chart.

1. Oils.  
    1980: 649 calories.  
    2013: 890 calories.  +241 calorie increase.

2. Sugar.  
    1980:  556 calories.  
    2013: 600 calories.  +44 calorie increase.

**Oil calories, specifically, were increased 5.4x the rate of sugar between these years and account for 80% of the fat calorie increase.  HUH.**  So, obviously people are both getting way too many calories and the majority of increase in any single segment was fat from oils.

First, I'd like to point out the source of vegetable oils in Standard American Diet (SAD).  It's not from whole plant foods because outside of a few exceptions (avocado, coconut, olives, soybeans, nuts and seeds) it's in ratios of 11% fat by calories or less.  Corn has about 11%, Potatoes are at 1%.  All [other starches](https://www.drmcdougall.com/health/education/free-mcdougall-program/steps-to-recovery/starch-staples/) hover in between these two.  It's not from greens, as they're so calorie dilute it's hard to get sizable amount of any type of calories from them.

Outside of nuts and seeds, the only big source of vegetable oils (or other added fat like butter) is consuming isolated and processed oil directly or through processed foods, which tend to be 33%-50+ fat by calories.  Ranging from french fries, deep fried chicken wings, to instant Ramen (deepfried noodles), to ready to eat frozen meals, most pastries, doughnuts, ice cream, cookies, candy bars, etc.  Very few ""treats"" are sugar only, the list is so short as to be laughable: lollipops, hard candy and similar.  Just about the only pure carb in the American snack aisle is limited to various forms of hard pretzels (European ones tend to have oil), everything else ""carby"" is probably a fat bomb in reality.

One easy example of a minimally processed food still made worse by manufacturers is simple popcorn.  Airpopped at home, at 1oz serving size, we're talking 106 calories per cup, about 11 calories from fat, so 10.5%, same as corn on the cob, unsurprisingly. Made ready to eat or microwave in a bag, it's usually around 150 calories, about 90 calories from fat, so 60% fat, way more than natural foods. And you get to eat under 2/3's the amount of actual popcorn kernels in comparison for that 1oz serving with the extra 46 calories overall because they're so weighed down by oil/fat calories.

Why is sugar a target?  Idk, I specifically think it's ""blood sugar"" scares.  Isolated, processed sugar is not good for low calorie density and weight loss, especially when we eat insane amounts like 112 lbs annually, about 28 4-lb bags.  However, sugar is not the main culprit here, more like an accomplice or junior partner in crime  -- other than in destroying teeth when there is no fiber to wash it away, especially in soda, sticky or hard candies.  And yet somehow in the mainstream, that ""conventional wisdom"" segways into an attack on sugar in all its forms, including fruits, pasta with tomato sauce, or potatoes, which as I was told by multiple ketoers ""is pure sugar"".  Meh.

tldr; During the start of the ""low fat era"", they told people to [eat these good carbs](https://imgur.com/ySel6EI) and instead people went out and ate [these bad ""carbs""](https://imgur.com/yY0C7XK), oft rich in oil, and now are blaming carbs as a whole.  The finger points to processed food, laden with oils making people fat, the obvious culprit.  **As usual, eat food as grown.**",0

Super real sugar craving in a dream,11,j8g6k8,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/j8g6k8/super_real_sugar_craving_in_a_dream/,8,1602342958.0,"Usually I don't have dreams. Not sure why. I used to when I was younger (27 yo rn). I think it's because of my sleep cycle, and the fact that unless you wake up after a dream, your brain doesn't have a way to remember it. I have really deep sleep almost always. 

Well today I had a dream about going from somewhere, stopping in 7/11 and buying candy, because I was craving sugar. I even remember how I tried to resist it, but I felt that physical need in my mouth to stuff myself with sweets and then just went for it. I got some sour haribos. 

And then this time, I woke up. After few moments of confusion and regret that I bought candy, I realized it was just a dream, and I was totally fine. Without any need for sugar what so ever. 

But what was super interesting for me, that in the dream, I sensed perfectly well that need for more sugar. I mean the physical feeling in your mouth, which is like a need for a scratch. The thing you have once you eat one candy and immediately *need* another. 

Interesting. 

Well that's all. Nice weekend to yall.",1

Supplements are more likely to be harmful than helpful?,1,ecmovd,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/ecmovd/supplements_are_more_likely_to_be_harmful_than/,14,1576751245.0,"I haven't seen any plant-based doctors differ on the subject of B12. They all seem to recommend supplementing this on a plant-based diet. However, I have seen differing opinions around other supplements like Vitamin D, DHA, iodine, etc.

For example, Pam Popper is not as big of a name as Dr. Greger, but her name sometimes comes up in the list of notable plant-based doctors. Both she and Greger try to rely on evidence when it comes to making decisions around diet, but Greger recommends many supplements while Popper does not. She has several videos on Youtube discouraging the use of Vitamin D, iodine, and other supplements and she cites studies to back up those recommendations. She generally insists that supplements have more potential to do harm than good.

As a layperson, I get confused about this stuff. I don't really feel smart enough to decipher all the evidence for myself. I'm curious if anyone else has noticed this discrepancy and managed to figure out the real evidence for themselves. 

I also noticed that Greger's daily dozen checklist (app version) no longer includes any supplements other than B12, so I wonder if he's considered Popper's perspective on this.

Here's an example of one of Popper's videos for reference:

With all of the brand new resolution folks posting, I have seen sweeteners come up so much by so many of you. I have seen posts about Swerve, Atkins, and more. As such, I wanted to make a post directly about artificial sweeteners and how they can affect keto. They can be your best friend or your worst enemy, and it largely depends on your body's chemistry as well as the type of sweetener.




***In general***

________________________________________________

In general, cutting out sweets can only help you stick to any diet easier. Sweet stuff tastes good and when things taste really good, we often find ourselves having just one more bite.


That said, I personally wouldn’t be on this lifestyle without sweeteners. Most of us simply want to be able to have a treat now and then. Being too restrictive can kill any type of health improvement by making it too daunting to achieve. As such, sweeteners are fine for most people to use. There are cautionary tales by some that they can increase cravings, but most people likely won’t experience this and it’s up to you to experiment to see if they are what is causing your cravings or not.


However, not all sweeteners are created equal. 



***Sweeteners to watch out for***

________________________________________________

>**Maltitol:** This is almost identical to sugar in terms of carbs, its impact on your blood sugar is very bad.  It simply has the same impact on you as downing sugar would for the most part. It also causes very distressing bowel movements when eaten too much. Sadly it tastes very good and almost like sugar, meaning it’s the #1 one people experiment with--and pay for later. **Almost all sugar free candies will use this one making them not a low carb option nor an option you want if you want to spend your life outside the bathroom.**


> **Xylitol:** While better than the other -tol, this one is very dangerous to dogs/cats. It’s toxic to them. It also can cause similar bowel issues if consumed in moderate to large doses.


>**Splenda:** The granulated version of Splenda has a lot of carbs. This is because it uses high GI sweeteners with Sucralose as binding agents, making it surprisingly bad for low carb diets, even if it is often suggested as a SF option. Liquid splenda or sucralose itself is fine, but if a product says ""Splenda (TM)"" it is likely using the granulated version. **The sugar free candies that are not using Maltitol will likely use this, making them a poor keto choice.**

>**Just Like Sugar (and anything with Malodextrin):** Malodextrin isn't good. It will often be used in products as a binding agent. Always read ingredients and, if it has that, be wary. Sometimes people will make Stevia mixes with it, completely off-setting the benefits Stevia has.





***Sweeteners to freely enjoy***
________________________________________________


> 
>**Stevia:** This is a great, natural sweetener. Its taste can be off-putting, but when you bake with it, you can use extracts to cover it up. I recently made a cranberry pie where I simply added extra vanilla extract to mask its taste.


> **Erythritol:** Another good one, this sweetener is gaining in popularity. Chocolate bars like Lily’s and ChocoPerfection both use this sweetener, and they taste pretty close to the real thing!


>**Monk Fruit:** I recently tried ChocZero which has monk fruit. It is the hardest to find since it is rarer. It is very, very good.


> **Allulose:** The new Quest cereal bars use this one. It tastes great, like really really really good. It has not impacted my blood sugar and I trust Quest largely because their protein bars have been a staple for many ketoers, so this may change as further research comes out, but it is a new sweetener.


> **Swerve/Truvia/Sukrin:** These are ~~two~~ three hybrids that mix sweeteners and they are GREAT for baking, coffee, and more. I highly suggest either one if you want to dabble in making your own keto baked goods, they are easy to use--and in the case of Swerve, they come in confectioner’s or granular, allowing you to make frostings! Redditor /u/mymagaboo has also informed me that Sukrin comes in Sukrin Gold which is a brown sugar substitute making it extra useful for baking projects.


> **EZSweetz/Liquid Splenda/Sucralose:** Remember how I said Splenda can kind of suck? Liquid splenda is actually great compared to its granular cousin, and you will find it often sold as generic liquid Sucralose. This isn’t the best sweetener ever and is probably the worst on this list of “good ones,” but it’s pretty decent as a drop or two in your coffee. It is VERY potent, meaning a single drop often satisfies what a few TBSP of sugar used to. The Da Vinci and Torani syrups use this to be sugar free as well, and they are safe to use.

> **Aspartame:** A lot of comments about this. Aspartame is pretty hated by a lot of health gurus as a ""bad"" sweetener, but I haven't been able to substantiate any of the hate it's gotten.  I have always had diet soda with it and I have never had any issues. A small percentage of people will have an insulin response to it, but research has proven there isn't one. I personally use it, but YMMV.




***Onto the products***

________________________________________________


The main reason I wanted to make this post is I wanted to suggest some good ones, shame some bad ones, and in general help out new ketoers find their substitute sweet.




***Products that are generally bad***
________________________________________________


>**Russell Stover Sugar Free chocolates**: After nearly six months here, I have seen so many posts about these suckers. They are a sham. They use Splenda and Maltitol, they are not low carb, and they will stall you en masse. If your macros can handle it, having 1 or 2 is a fine treat (and technically better than sugar, as it’s slightly less carbs), but anyone who is snacking on these for their calories will have more cravings and likely be knocked out of ketosis. I have had their sugar free mint patties, one a day, as a dessert for a few weeks to no ill effects but I made sure that I was eating virtually zero carbs the days I did indulge.

>**Hershey’s Sugar Free Bars/Reeses/etc**: Same deal as Russell Stovers, avoid.

>**Werther’s Originals/Gummy Bears/Twizzlers/Jelly Belly SF Beans**: Same deal.

>**Asher's Chocolates**: Same deal.


>**La Nouba**: La Nouba’s stuff tastes so good. Sadly most of it uses maltitol. It is a huge shame because they make sugar free marshmallows that taste perfect. They do have chocolate bars with Stevia that are OK.


>**Atkins Bars and Candies**: These are another sham. They use maltitol, they will make you feel sick, and their carb count is a bold lie because of the sweetener they use. When they say 3g carbs, it’s really more like 15-20g *per* bar. If you achieve success eating them, it’s likely because you stayed under calorie counts or already ate virtually zero carbs meaning you were still in keto after eating one. They aren’t worth it.


>**Beef Jerky**: I just wanted to put this one out here, a lot of people eat jerky without realizing it has been drenched in sugar. Try biltong jerky over the regular stuff as well or get a dehydrator to make your own so you can control what goes in it. Random life tip!
    




***Products that are good alternatives***


________________________________________________

> **ChocZero chocolate**. I love ChocZero. It came out recently and is taking the keto community by storm. But it's really, really good. Their 50% dark is their best by far and they use monk fruit (no sugar alcohols) which makes me love them.

> **Lily’s chocolate bars**. I’m not a shill, but I love these things. They taste great, the only downside is they do use Erythritol. They have a lot of flavors as well, I found their regular milk chocolate to be the best with their coconut to also be good.

> **ChocoPerfection**: These taste nearly identical to Lily’s, slightly harder to get, but just as good. They make a great dark chocolate orange bar.


> **Quest bars and Quest cereal bars**: very good protein bars. That said, the cereal bars taste completely different--and I like them a lot more! They taste like cereal granola bars and are 3g carbs a pop, a great dessert.


> **Halo Top/Artic Zero**: Some people hate AZ's taste, myself included, but I am including it since so many like it. These two ice cream subsitutes rock. They are very low carb and made with sweeteners that have low GI. If you can afford the calories, add a few TBSP of heavy cream in with them and make it into a milkshake--you will thank me later.

> **Skinny Syrups, Da Vinci Syrups & Torani**: These are sweetened with liquid Splenda and they are awesome for baking as well as coffee and tea. I highly suggest picking these up if you are missing something: I recently did an eggnog flavored tea with their eggnog SF Da Vinci syrup and it was heavenly :)

> **Nutritious Living Hi Lo Cereal**: this one is a mixed bag, it’s about 5-9g of carbs per serving depending on the flavor. It does use cane sugar. That said, it is a minor amount and has never knocked me out of keto as long as I have one serving (½ a cup). I feel like it is a perfect cereal substitute if you are one of those lazy people who sometimes craves cereal in the morning.  Since it is almost all fiber, it is very filling compared to other higher carb low carb products (err, that came out badly, but you know what I mean?).


> **Extremely dark chocolates**: These will be low carb naturally, even if they have a bit of sugar. Most have about 5g of carbs a serving. I personally like Lindt’s 85-90% in small squares. Easy to track and a great treat to savor with tea.

> **Biltong jerky:** While most jerky is very sugar heavy, some brands won't be. Additionally, biltong jerky is a style of jerky that is very low on sugar. Always check the label, but even sugar heavy brands often make their biltong jerky have only 1-2g carbs an ounce!

> **Epic Bars:** Epic bars are really good albeit very expensive. They make a bacon bar that tastes amazing with no extra sweeteners or anything. Highly suggest them if you are going for a wholesome, filling snack that won't damage your diet.

> **Homemade goods**: These aren’t as bad to make as you think. Some Swerve, butter, and almond flour literally makes amazing shortbread cookies. In general, you can use almond flour in lieu of regular flour then use Truvia/Swerve/Stevia to cover the sugar and make the majority of the recipes you used to make. There are thousands of awesome recipes online and on r/ketoreceipes. 

> **Have any others?** I will add them here, let me know.

I've had a lot of success at restaurants. I've got this, it's a seafood place, should be pretty easy. NOPE. I usually look at menus before I go to a new restaurant, but I didn't have time. I get there, EVERYTHING IS FRIED IN BATTER!!! They have almost no non fried options, and those are drenched in some sugar nonsense glaze. This place has damn carbs in the water it seems. I went with it, had shrimp and some fish, and avoided sides. I'm pretty sure that I am probably knocked out of keto regardless. I'm not going to obsess over it, or worry. I'm just back doing keto in the morning. But if we are going to keep dating, we aren't going to do it at Joe's.

My life was flipped upside down. For the next 13 years, life was beyond difficult, spent all of my teenage years and early 20s in the hospital. I took so much medication, including high doses of prednisone on a regular basis (if you’ve taken steroids you know how quickly you gain weight). 

Fast forward to 26: I was so sick, I had to get two surgeries to remove my entire colon. I’m now a J poucher. After surgery, the freedom to eat more of what I wanted (but yes with butt burn) was all the worth it. Needless to say, I gained plenty of weight. I heard about keto from a random person and decided to give it a try. People have always told me I’m not a big girl (5’3) but every time I looked in the mirror I saw the girl I use to see on prednisone- a moon faced, sad girl. 

I had a dream to be around 115 pounds. I would always put it down on my license when they asked CW even though I was FAR FROM IT. I got on the scale this morning (round three of keto) and I’m at 116.4!!!!! Practically cried on the weighing machine. I look in the mirror and I no longer see my colitis but a confident girl 😭😭

"Thank you, Darius at McDonald's!",2138,afduxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/afduxc/thank_you_darius_at_mcdonalds/,220,1547369218.0,"I was on and off of keto all throughout 2018, never able to stick to it mostly due to financial struggle and depression. I'm still dealing with the financial shit and the depression but I've made a point to start back and take it more seriously. One week in and so far, so good. 


Months ago, I discovered an easy lunch I could grab on my hour break from work, but it was a ""complicated"" order at McDonalds. I use quotes because honestly it isnt that difficult, but 9 times out of 10, they found a way to fuck it up, all the while acting annoying that I'd have such ridiculous dietary needs in the first place. But finally I found one store with a dedicated employee who not only got my order right, but made it look BEAUTIFUL and remembered me every time I rolled through, which became pretty often. 


My order is essentially a bunless burger on a platter. Two quarter-pound patties, each with a slice of cheese and tomato, served on a bed of lettuce. A ramekin of mac sauce on the side. That's it! And its filling and delicious and only about $4, so I consider it my weekly indulgence on the days I don't meal prep. I've actually posted an image of the meal on this account if you want to behold it in all its meaty-cheesy glory. And yes, I eat the whole thing in my car while watching The Office before going back to work.



Well, it has been about 2 or 3 months since I've been keto, so I haven't revisited that McDonald's nor tried that order anywhere else. This week, on a short lunch break, I begrudgingly made my way to their drive-thru, dreading having to explain all over again exactly how to make my order, having to bother the kitchen staff to go out of the way for me, being made to feel annoying, and ultimately getting *not* what I ordered. 


So it began in the usual way - I pulled up to the drive thru and rolled down my window. 


*Hi, Welcome to McDonald's! What can I get for you today?*

**Umm, well, I'm sorry - my order is kind of weird --**

*Hello again! It's been a while! Let me see... two patties... cheese on both? With lettuce and tomato? Is that correct?*

**Uh Wow, yeah! And also --**

*A mac sauce on the side! Itll be $4.03, please pull around!*


So I'm sitting there a little astonished that of the thousands of customers they must've had since me, this one employee remembered me and my entire order - and even stepped away from the payment window to check with the kitchen and make sure it came out right - and has never once treated me like a bother!


Even the guy at the second window was like, ""Wow, that's quite an order."" (I really don't get why it's so strange but whatever.)


So anyway, it wasn't a big deal or anything but it did make me feel really good, not to mention how impressed I was at how this young man handles his job.


Thank you Darius! 


TLDR; Had a complicated Mcdonalds order. Dude remembered my order a few months after I went on hiatus and still made it perfectly without making me feel like a nuisance!


PS - I have reached out to corporate and left a detailed compliment regarding Darius and his work ethic so hopefully that review trickles down to him in some way. I'm also going to start carrying cash so I can tip him next time. I believe dedicated work deserves reward.


Edit:

- For those asking, mac sauce is 3 carbs per serving (which is either 1/4 cup or 3 TBSP, not sure. I can usually fit that into my day.



- I order it the way I order it because ala carte patties are cheaper than ordering the Double QP, and the quarter-pound patties are larger than the mcdouble and the like. 


- Nobody ever said anything about anyone being 'stupid' or 'incompetent' for not getting the order right. I know the order can be confusing which is why it's so nice that Darius not only gets it right but exceeds expectations. I mean [just look at it](http://imgur.com/a/njXgHeI) in all [its cheesy glory.](https://imgur.com/pUFXAfO)


- Thank you for all the other fast food keto pointers! I'll have to try them out on future lunch breaks.



Edit 2 - I've used the app before but I actually really enjoy human interaction so I usually refrain from stuff like that unless I'm really not feeling social, which happens occasionally!

I still tried things but not much success. Nov 6th I reached the end of my rope, & with complete desperation I prayed asking God to send me help. That I will do whatever is needed to get healthy but I needed directio & His intervention in my life. That morning I went to the gym as I usually do to do my 1hr cardio. To my surprise I ran into an old gym friend that had disappeared for a couple of years. He told me he had another  heart attack a few months back but with the supervision of his cardiologist he began LCHF lifestyle. He lost 50lbs in 3 months. Earlier in May I went to my cardiologist who kept ignoring my side effects of Lipitor. I told him that I won't take those any more and so he told me to leave. So after talking with my old gym friend he recommended I go see his cardiologist. So I did. Turns out my new cardiologist was a former student and former colleague of my prior cardiologist. My new cardiologist said the best thing I did was to stop taking Lipitor. He put me on LCHF and since then, I have lost 22lbs, improved my triglycerides & HDL to normal levels & decreased my LDL by 50 points. I also read Jimmy Moore's book Keto Clarity and have learned so much about how to change my eating. I am so thankful for the changes. I started out at 350lbs and have a long way to go but when you get desperate for change the commitment is natural. My wife noticed I don't seem to eat nearly as much as I used to. This is simply a natural occurrence for me since I started Keto. She is healthy, thin, a marathon runner, & because of the changes in me, she has gone Keto.

They offer a pre scripted keto-diet with unchangeable macros (5% carbs, 15% protein and 80% fat). Bear in mind that you cannot change these macros at any point during the diet script but that the database does include most European foodstuffs.
For 12 weeks I exercised abnormally much and fully expected to lose fat and gain muscle. What happened is that I indeed lost fat but my muscle-mass flatlined. 
Turns out the protein macro is way way way low for me. On a normal day, it came to 50 grams in Lifesum. Last week I posted this and some of you were kind enough to nicely (instead of know-it-ally and bitchily) point out that protein was unnecessarily low.

I upped it to 110 grams per day last Wednesday, and lo and behold, I can now see my bi and tri ceps actually becoming larger. In 5 days and one intense exercise session and enough protein in the daily plan.

It reeks of dogmatism to me and as a whole, I find myself against dogmatic beliefs. I like that this sub has guidelines for what is and is not plant based, but by and large doesn't judge when someone isn't plant based 100% of the time. Sometimes you go out and veg is sauteed in oil. Sometimes you just need a piece of chocolate cake.

"Thanks to Disney Magic, I’m going Keto. What’s your keto origin story?",1694,7ylvtv,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7ylvtv/thanks_to_disney_magic_im_going_keto_whats_your/,312,1519066567.0,"Well let’s start at the beginning. First we had to fly to Florida. Fat and Flying do not mix. It sucks. Everyone looking at the seat next to you and seeing the “hell no” look on their face. Next, we arrive and my step-father in law had at least one fat joke/condescending remark a day. I offered to take out the trash and he said that it was in the garage but he’ll take it out because I probably won’t fit. We load up in my MIL’s little 2 door car to go to Disney World and I didn’t fit. I’m tall but my belly limits me leaning forward to get in the car. We go to Disney and the first ride we get on I don’t fit in with my wife and the 2 other people so she has to get out and wait for the next car with me. Eventually we go to the super popular Avatar Flight of Passage and wait 2 hours in line. When we get to the ride I didn’t fit. My “calves were too large” which is code for we haven’t even tried locking the back brace fatty. Also, I know my calves are large because how much work they do carrying the rest of me around. So I have to get off the ride and it is 4 stories down and about a 1/4 mile walk down a corridor to exit. This was such a walk of shame. I pulled my hat down low so the cameras and the people outside don’t see the 27 year old 6’2 362lb grown man with tears rolling down his face. Words can’t describe the absolute feeling of shame. I felt worthless, like I was a burden and inconvenience to everyone around me. I felt lost and didn’t know what to do. It was like the usual self consciousness what magnified a million times. I don’t think skinny people understand the day to day self consciousness fat people go through on a daily basis. Elevators, airplanes, booths at restaurants, shopping for clothes, never being able to own a Jurassic Park tshirt because you can’t find it in your size (seems random but it’s relevant I promise) there is so much more turmoil to being fat beyond the physical issues. It hurts your spirit. Life is full of micro disappointments that many people never experience.  There’s no support group for “I really wanted it but they didn’t have it in my size” or  No one wants to sit next to me on planes Anonymous or People at concerts get grossed out when your arm touches theirs because you’re sweating awareness 5k.  Every one of these moments culminated and magnified in this walk of shame. I was devistated. 

We go ride Dinosaur next. Afterwards my wife insists I get something from the gift shop because Dinosaurs have always been fascinating to me. I see a shirt with sauropod that says vegetarian, one with a T. rex on it that says low carb, and another with a T. rex that says carnivore. It’s not the Disney magic I was expecting but I took it as a sign. None of the shirts were in my size, obviously, but I found a pin set that had all of them so I got that. Now I’m up because our hotel bed was too small and I was tired of fighting of fall off and the unevenness causing my wife to keep rolling into me. 

Idk if this is post is even allowed but I just needed to get all of this off my chest. If anyone wants to share their “origin story” I’d love to hear it. And when you see a “before” picture at Disney World you’ll know that’s me. 

Tl;dr Fat and Flying don’t mix, my step-father in law is a bully, couldn’t ride a ride at Disney world, received a sign from Mickey to do keto. Sleep deprived because I had to choose between my wife or myself, having a good night sleep thanks to shitty hotel beds and me being fat. 

Edit: I am dumbfounded. Thank you everyone. I am going to keep this post bookmarked for when I feel like quitting. BONUS: I am terrified of roller coasters but today we’re going to Magic Kingdom and I’m going to ride all of them. It’s going to be my first step to stop all of the excuses I’ve ever had. No more “can’t”. No more fear.  ",1

The Chair,1558,du4dfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/du4dfp/the_chair/,218,1573374902.0,"Hello friends!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  As I approach another ketoversary, I find myself beginning to ruminate on days of keto past.  Thinking of the things that have changed.  Remembering what life was so that I may appreciate what life has become.  And on the cusp on my ketoversary, I want to tell you about my chair.  

Of course, I am BigTex and as such, the chair is not a normal everyday chair.  Here is a [NICE PICTURE](https://i.imgur.com/JyLCohj.jpg) of the chair.  As you can see, it is just a standard looking industrial type of chair.  Dirty.  Well worn.  Rest assured, the chair is special because it has a 1000 pound capacity.  Half a ton.  To put that in perspective, a Ford F-150 pickup is a half ton truck meaning that it’s payload capacity is 1000 pounds.  So my chair will haul like a Ford F-150.

Why am I so concerned with a chair?  Well, because the chair represents so much in my life.  So much good AND so much bad.

I bought the chair before I was a keto’er.  Back in the days before a scale was in my world.  I didn't know my weight, but I weighed over 600 pounds.  Even at that svelt poundage, I could sit in that chair and not worry about it breaking.  That chair was a fat man’s best friend because it was a worry free sitting down chair.  When you weigh over 600 pounds, worry free sitting is pretty damn nice.  It was really important for me because I couldn’t stand for more than a couple of minutes without my back killing me so I did plenty of flopping down in the chair.  Very few graceful landings.  But the chair didn’t care.  It held me like a champ.

It was during this time that the chair represented certainty.  Certainty that I wouldn’t bust my ass when I sat down.

November 14, 2016 I began eating a ketogenic diet.  I weighed 593 pounds that morning.  Threedom, twotopia, and onederland are phrases that we get excited about.  I was once excited about...well, what should we call it?  Five-A-Live?  Fi de Vivre?  Cinco de Lardo has a nice Tex Mex sound to it.  Anyway, I was excited to ONLY weigh 593 pounds.  I probably shouldn’t put that line on my resume.

For some reason, keto fit me pretty well.  I often write to newbies about “hope” because keto gave me hope.  Keto gave me the desire to stop existing and start living.  Yet I was still a big big big Texan.  And the chair was my best friend.  I couldn’t stand very long, so I pulled the chair up to the kitchen counter and prepared meals.  Get up and stir food then sit back down in the chair.  Chop some more veggies while sitting in the chair.

The chair was a huge part of my life during this time.  The cravings were massive at times so I would clean.  Again, I couldn’t stand very long, so I would move the chair to the center of the kitchen and sweep and mop while sitting in the chair.  I would pull the chair up to the sink and wash dishes while sitting in the chair.  I have a dishwasher, but washing dishes was burning more calories.  So I sat and washed dishes.

I have a pretty cool kitchen table.  It is small and it folds and it works perfectly for me.  The chairs are NOT 500 pound BigTex Friendly chairs, so I ate my keto-riffic meals while sitting in the chair.  Eating keto and losing weight.

It was during this time that the chair represented freedom and hope.  Freedom from fat and hope that I can be the man that I want to be.

Today, whenever company comes to visit me and space runs short, I sit in the chair.  It is too big for my butt.  Uncomfortable on my ass.  My back doesn’t fit it quite right.  I tend to squirm when I sit in the chair.  But I NEED to sit in the chair every now and then.  I NEED the chair to be uncomfortable because comfort MIGHT create complacency.

The chair sits in the living room of the BigTex World Headquarters.  The BigTex Bachelor Pad.  People look at it strangely.  It doesn’t “fit” the style of the room.  It’s bulky.  It’s “institutional”.  To the uninitiated, the chair is ugly.  To a visitor, there is no reason for the chair to be in the living room.

My new friends don’t know that 600 pound Brian existed.  They don’t know BigTex.  They just know that I eat weird and keep an ugly chair in my living room.  That’s ok.  Today, I am the guy with an ugly chair.  My new friends won’t understand the chair.  This is why I write about the chair to you.

Hello r/keto.  My name is Brian.  3 years ago today, I weighed 600 pounds.  No matter how bad you feel about yourself right now, I felt worse about myself.  And yet, as my fourth year of eating keto approaches, I sit on my sofa writing to you, looking at the chair.  I am full of hope.  Today, I have dreams that three years ago were not entertained.  

It’s a beautiful chair because every time I look at it, I remember who I once was.     

It’s a beautiful chair because every time I look at it, I remember who I am.     

It’s a beautiful chair because every time I look at it, I see who I can be.

It's only a chair.  A chair full of hopes and dreams.",1

I love being able to check my blood sugar level on my own terms and I love being able to check my ketone level. BUT, the reason I purchased it in the first place was that so I could ""experiment"" with different carb levels to see what I could ""get away with.""

I won't sugar-coat it (no pun intended), I bought the thing to help me cheat. I've heard some people can stay in Ketosis at 50 net and I wanted to find out how far I could push the envelope. However, I've yet to use it for that intended purpose. In fact, I have no struggle with my calorie intake or macros at all and have no DESIRE to eat above 30 net. 

I'll never get rid of it because I love it and it's still convenient, but if you are thinking about purchasing it for the same reason I did, don't bother. Purchase it because it's cheap, small and convenient, and the included drawing device is painless. I have a super low tolerance for seeing my own blood or getting pricked by needles. In fact, I often faint or have a seizure when trying to get blood drawn at the doctor as they seem to have a hard time hitting the vein, until eventually they started using the same needle they would use for a child. 

The first time I used the meter and the drawing device, it took me about 35 seconds to actually press the button that engages the needle, but it was painless and gets just the right amount of blood out for the test. You wipe it with the alcohol swab and the wound is closed before you know it. Testing takes a total of 3 minutes from opening the storage case through to cleanup. It really is a marvel of modern technology and reasonably priced. ",1

> From my patients at the Hamakua Sugar Plantation, between 1973 and 1976, I had learned the cause of over 80% of the diseases afflicting people in North America and the rest of the Western world. My elderly patients had immigrated to Hawaii from China, Japan, Korea, and the Philippines, where rice was food. They brought their culture with them. Their children, tempted by Western foods, slowly changed. The third generation, had essentially given up rice and vegetables for meat, dairy, and junk. For all three generations, their health reflected their diet. The first generation immigrants were trim, active, and medication-free into their 90s. They had no diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, or cancers of the breast, prostate, or colon.  Their children became a little fatter and sicker, and most of their grandchildren had lost all of their immunity to obesity and common diseases — in every way of appearance and health, they were full-fledged Americans.

One day, feeling somewhat hopeless about my diabetes, Kim and I decided to watch Forks Over Knives. This video was so inspirational that after watching it I felt I had to give it a try. The documentary was well done and it just made sense. I also purchased the book Dr. Neal Barnard’s Program for Reversing Diabetes. Between watching Forks Over Knives and reading Dr. Neal Barnard’s Progam for Reversing Diabetes, Kim and I decided to try this way of eating. On 12-3-2011 we both began our whole food, plant based diet and my life and health has not been the same since. I follow three basic guidelines for eating: I eat no animal products, I eat low fat foods, and I avoid high glycemic foods. I enjoy foods such as oatmeal with cinnamon and raisins, pasta prima vera with marinara sauce, bean burritos with jalepeno peppers, veggie subs, veggie burgers, and plenty of fruits and vegetables such as strawberries and sweet potatoes. (Notice that this is not a low carb diet. I enjoy a lot of complex carbs. Carbs are not the enemy. High fat foods are. Fat gets in cells and prevents insulin and glucose from working properly.)

My wife and I were arguing. It was my fault and I was just letting her vent (if you make a mistake you have to take the punishment). She was really passionate about what she was talking about. I was standing there shirtless and in the middle of her talking I crossed my arms across my chest. She immediately got red, a little flustered and kind of just stopped talking.  I asked her what was wrong? She said “you can’t just stand there shirtless with your chest and big arms, I can’t concentrate on being mad at you.”

Be kind, sometimes the mirrors/rooms are dirty. This is just my life now.



Hoping that anyone who is having doubts or struggles sees this post. I started at 210lbs a little over a year ago. I've fallen off and gotten back on this diet more times than I'd like to admit. I have a few disabilities that make it difficult for me to exercise to the extent that I'd like, but despite that I have still managed to lose quite a bit of weight. My arthritis and asthma(severe) pretty much went away within the first 2 months. I've been able to get off almost all of my medications (suck it military docs).

I've done mostly lazy keto, figured out what worked best for me (bacon) and pretty much ate the same couple of food items everyday. Still not tired of bacon btw! Point is, weight loss is not linear, there will be ups and down, you may fall off, just get right back on the next day. Don't beat yourself up about it, but also don't keep giving in. This is a lifestyle change.

> The Bratman Orthorexia Self-Test*

>If you are a healthy-diet enthusiast, and you answer yes to any of the following questions, you may be developing orthorexia nervosa:

>(2) When I eat any food I regard to be unhealthy, I feel anxious, guilty, impure, unclean and/or defiled; even to be near such foods disturbs me, and I feel judgmental of others who eat such foods.

>(3) My personal sense of peace, happiness, joy, safety and self-esteem is excessively dependent on the purity and rightness of what I eat.

>(4) Sometimes I would like to relax my self-imposed “good food” rules for a special occasion, such as a wedding or a meal with family or friends, but I find that I cannot. (Note: If you have a medical condition in which it is unsafe for you to make ANY exception to your diet, then this item does not apply.)

>(5) Over time, I have steadily eliminated more foods and expanded my list of food rules in an attempt to maintain or enhance health benefits; sometimes, I may take an existing food theory and add to it with beliefs of my own.

[More After](https://imgur.com/a/UiRDm4e)

I met my husband u/LongRustyMonk when I was 15 years old. I was a size 8 at the time but of course my body was not remotely fully formed. My hips were still growing, my bones were still growing and I was still going through puberty. To compare myself to that size/shape now as a 27 year old woman is fruitless. Still, over the years, I have compared myself many times. Being in a relationship and spending endless Saturdays and summers cuddled on the sofa surrounded by Doritos and milkshakes slowly led to me piling on the pounds. At 19 years old we rented our first place together, around the same time I started a full time job at McDonald's. Without Mum cooking me dinner and with permission to take home from work bags containing enough leftover fries and nuggets to feed a small army, my weight kept on soaring. I got to a point of eating 5 McDonald's meals a day - I was addicted.

When I was half-way to 20, my Mum could see that things were spiralling out of control and so offered me the incentive of an all expenses paid shopping trip if I lost some weight before my 20th birthday. A week later I signed up at Weight Watchers and weighed in at the heaviest I had ever been and ever would be  - 15 stone and 8 pounds - I was a size 18-20 and needed an inhaler to get up the stair. This was the first real diet I had ever been on (bar trying grapefruits / slim shakes / Adios diet pills in college) and I took to it like a duck to water. I lost 69.5 pounds in 5 months. I was the youngest member of the class and everyone was inspired by me - it felt amazing. My husband even joined me a couple of months in to support me and lost some weight too and we became part of the staff.

When I reached 10st 8.5 pounds - it all went wrong.

My goal had been 10st 8 pounds and I just couldn't shift that last half a pound. Not that I ever really stalled - it was only 3 weeks. But I'd gone from losing every single week and I just couldn't take it. I felt like a failure.

Over the following 8 months I spiralled in to bulimia - somehow managing to hide it from everyone whilst feeling trapped in my own personal hell. Eventually the burden became too much to bear and I broke down to my husband, confessing everything. I never made myself sick again. (I never even shook that half a pound throughout my bulimia - I just maintained and then slowly gained and gained, all the while eating ridiculous volumes of junk food whilst hidden in the bathroom).

What followed was 6 years of yo-yo dieting hell, starting at my top weight once again. I gave Weight Watchers another go, losing a couple of stone and then regaining it all. Then I tried Slimming World - the same happened again. I tried Low Carb (the wrong way - trying to see how much bread I could fit in to 50g carbs a day.) Still, I wasn't happy. I tried Low Carb a couple more times, singing it's praises and its satiety - but I'd only last a month or so, eat a cake and then end up right back at the beginning again.

It finally changed when earlier this year, having rid myself of all junk food in the house, I was so desperate for sugar that I baked myself a tray of 12 cupcakes and ate them fresh from the oven with a spoon. My husband turned around from his game and saw what I was doing and I burst in to tears. I couldn't keep doing this to myself. We had a long talk and decided this was it - things would change.

On the 11th June 2018 I started Low Carb properly (50g net carbs a day) and stuck to it religiously, even throughout a holiday to the Lake District which had a lot of cream teas and stodgy pub food to offer. I found I wasn't really losing weight, even though I had more energy.

On 12th July 2018 I decided to try something I never had before. Keto. 20g net carbs a day. It sounded impossible. With Low Carb I always hit 50g and always fancied a little bit more. I could still fit in space raiders crisps and fun size bags of haribo. How could anyone do 20g carbs a day?!

But you know what... I bloody well went and done it.

On 26th January 2019, just 6 months after starting keto, I reached the elusive 10st 8 pounds. I just couldn't believe it. Seeing that number looking back at me from the scale felt so surreal. It's the middle of Feb now and I've lost 4 more pounds and I feel incredible. I joined a gym at the end of December (something I never thought I'd do) and I can feel and see muscles forming throughout my body. It's crazy!! I'm so frickin' happy!

The NSVs along the way (as well as my wonderfully supportive husband) have made the journey all the more special:

\- I wore a size 10 red dress to the Office Christmas party. (A dream I'd harboured for many years), I went out drinking in a sparkly body con dress, I joined a gym and exercise without embarrassment in front of strangers, I can go shopping for size 10 and size small clothes, I've lost more than the body weight of my 13 year old sister, I've lost a total of 30.5 inches across my body (10.5 off of my waist!), I've gone down 3 ring sizes (I didn't even realise I had fat fingers), I'll wear clothes that show my arms, I've lost over a third of my body weight, I've inspired others to start keto (others that a couple of months ago told me to cut back on the bacon cause it'll kill me)

All of the above, a few months ago, seemed laughable and unattainable and downright impossible but here I am. I've hit my goal but I'm going to keep going and keep making my body stronger and keep on keto-ing on because I love this way of life and dreams really do come true.

TLDR: Nearly a decade of yo-yo dieting, cured by keto.

You cheat on a test, you get a great score! You cheat on your girlfriend, you get hot lovin' from someone else (obvious downsides with that of course). 

But when talking about cheat meals, and cheating on diets, it makes no sense. If you say you cheat, that would imply you are succeeding (ie. losing weight) with less effort or some other means. You're just failing. There is zero upside. Cheating in this case would be doing keto, the getting liposuction and pretending that it was keto - net gain, weight loss.

One year down and first goal achieved! I have set my next two goals. 1. Run a half marathon and 2. Get to 13% body fat and 180 lbs. I now know I can achieve both and that’s all thanks to keto and what I’ve been able to accomplish over the past year.

The first 10 months was diet only, I stalled in December, but over the past two months I have been doing AX-1 from AthleanX. I just started training for a half marathon and just last week ran 14.5 miles including a 5 mile run on Saturday in 45 minutes!

Stats: 3/‘19 - 3/‘20

Think Keto is too expensive or takes too much time to prepare keto meals? Here's how I made 12 meals in under 5 minutes for $1.72 a meal.,1787,45tfb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/45tfb9/think_keto_is_too_expensive_or_takes_too_much/,411,1455518505.0,"Hi everyone, I see a lot of posts about people saying keto is too expensive or it takes too much time to prepare meals that are keto if you want to save money. Well here's what I do to make 2 weeks worth of lunches for myself in under 5 minutes for $1.72 a meal.

This is what you will need:

http://imgur.com/D0tqFTh

1 bag of Broccoli florets

2 jars of Alfredo sauce. (I got 2 different kinds to switch things up)

2 packs of precooked chicken strips (I got 1 grilled and 1 fajita to switch things up).

And 14 tupperware bowls. If you don't have these, get them now! they are a great investment and you can get a 4 pack for $2.50 at Walmart. Here's a 5 pack on Amazon for $2.79 I suggest picking up a couple packs of these.

In this guide I made 12 meals because I ran out of clean tupperware, but you will have enough ingredients for 14 meals.

Here's the receipt for everything (ignore the bath rug lol).

http://imgur.com/djovKVq

The total comes out to be $24.04 so for 14 meals that is $1.72 a meal.

Ok so now the prepping process:

Lay out all of your Tupperware on a counter or table like so.

http://imgur.com/jLbSXe9

Line the bottom of all of them with broccoli

http://imgur.com/aggm9Uo

Place the pieces of the precooked frozen chicken over the broccoli

http://imgur.com/QD2W47X

Add the Alfredo sauce to each containter

Slap a lid on those bad boys and you're done!

http://imgur.com/b0IvCpc

Store them in the freezer until you're ready to eat

http://imgur.com/agVJptp

When you're ready to eat one just place it in the microwave for 3 minutes and 30 seconds

http://imgur.com/vfSjAh1

http://imgur.com/D5ykJjR

Give it a stir when its done cooking and blammo, you have yourself a ready to eat keto meal!

http://imgur.com/o6h6E4q

Macros for each meal:

7.5g of fat

22g of protein

4g of net carbs

200 calories

Sometimes I'll toss in a scoop of coconut oil or a tablespoon of butter if I want to get the fat and calories up. With a table spoon of butter the fat is raised to 19.5g and the meal is 302 calories.

I hope my technique helps many of you out who are just like me who have no time and are doing keto on a budget.

Thanks for reading! Keto on!

Last summer, I weighed about 135 pounds (I’m 5’7 and was 18 at the time). Then in autumn, I started birth control and a steroid at the same time. I naturally gain about 10 pounds in the winter anyway, and I’ve been eating very poorly. I also stopped my antidepressants and my binge eating eating habit came back.

So I just weighed myself, and I’m 178 pounds... I’m super disappointed in myself and want to get back on track with my weight/overall health. It’s mostly my eating habits that are holding me back, as I walk at least 5 miles a day at work, according to my step tracker (it’s usually more like 6-7 though). But I’m also going to start doing cardio on my days off. 

I’ll admit I hate vegetables, I’m okay with fruit though. What should I eat more of, and what should I stay away from? How much weight do people normally lose when they go plant based, if they’re overweight like me?",0

I noticed early on that my body started to become emaciated so I knew I wasn't hitting my macros. I upped my intake and I found I needed 2400 cals per day at 180g fat 130g protein and 40 carbs. 

Now these numbers might seem easy to pull off but they are NOT. I would eat a pound of hamburger, 5 strips of bacon, with a tbsp of mayo, a slice of cheddar cheese, onions, tomato, and lettuce and only get to about 900 calories. At breakfast I would do 4 eggs (2 just yolk), 2 cups of kale, and 5 to 8 strips of bacon. Which off the top of my head is 7 to 900 calories.

At this point I simply wasn't hungry anymore. I just don't need to eat as much when I'm on keto but the most I can really hope to force down my throat is 2000 calories in a day. Is there something I am missing? I want to do this diet because I have some rare mental health conditions that I think it would alleviate, as well as atopic dermatitis, but its appearing to be more and more impossible.

I've definitely felt the difference, and dropping a few pounds always feels great, but I've found it's put me in some incredibly irritating positions.   

Like for example, I was heading into the city for a meeting, and my train was cancelled. The next one wasn't for over an hour, and the trip was going to take at least an hour once I got on the train, so I figured I'd grab something to take with me to eat. There was practically *nothing* being sold in the station that I could have - everything was pastries, sandwiches, candy, fried food etc. I ended up getting a big bag of peanuts, but that's close to 600kcal for something that's really nothing more than a big snack. 

Next, I'm visiting some friends for a Christmas market. We walk around, check out the stalls, we get hungry so we buy some bratwurst. That's cool, I can have that and throw the bread away. Then they go and buy a big sharing bucket of beers and some biscuits to share. Nope, can't get it on that. Then we head off to a Japanese restaurant for a meal in the evening. Again, 99% of the menu is off limits, I ended up taking about ten minutes describing my diet to the waitress before she amended my order (she couldn't understand why I'd do it unless I had allergies). Even though my friends are supportive, they do get exasperated at me, and with good reason, I feel like I'm being so awkward. 

Basically, I'm just ranting about how widespread the whole carb thing is, and how I've never noticed how ingrained it is in western society. It's infuriating.  

How do you guys do it? Do you pack meals with you every single day? What if you're stuck in an unexpected position with no pre-prepared food, do you just go hungry? Or do you break the diet? How about when you're out with friends?",1

I don't want to eat a box of ice cream; I want to be around when my kids have kids, and instill a healthy lifestyle in them.

Tonight I won the battle; I ate a rib-eye and asparagus. Tonight the confrontation was mine; I lifted weights, biked six miles, ran a mile, and did 40-lb weighted hill climbs. Tomorrow once more into the fray.

I wish all of you success in whatever battle you are fighting tonight and whatever war you are engaged in for your life.

At first I thought it was coffee, so I stopped drinking it, but still had acid/heartburn. Then I thought it was my meds, but despite still taking the same meds, my acid went away for the past few months while in quarantine.

So then I thought it was just stress-related, and that working from home solved the issue.

But then i had a jar of overnight oats (old fashioned oats, chia, flax, plant-based milk, coconut yogurt) for breakfast the other morning and it all came back exactly as I remembered it - painful, burning acid reflux shortly after breakfast that lasts several hours. Turns out the acid had gone away because, during lockdown, I strayed away from my usual oat-based breakfast since I had more time to cook and experiment.

Worth noting that this always seems to happen no matter how ""fancy"" or ""boring"" my oats are. The recipe I mentioned above has quite a few ingredients, but even when I eat plain oats with water and fruit, I still react the same way.

Is this common? It seems so strange to me that *oatmeal* of all things—and homemade oatmeal at that—would cause acid reflux. Meanwhile, I'm fine while eating processed foods (like a bagel with tofu cream cheese, or tofu scramble with vegan cheese and hot sauce, etc.). What gives?",0

I just want to take a minute to point out that you don't need these things in order to succeed with keto. While I may have them, the only time I've actually used them is when I'm purposely fasting to break a stall, which has happened like twice.

Instead, here's what's actually happening:

* If I'm hungry, I eat. Sometimes until I'm not hungry anymore, sometimes until I'm totally satiated and couldn't eat if I wanted to.

* If I'm not hungry, I don't eat.

* 99% of the time if someone offers me carby food I'll say no, not because of discipline or dedication but because I genuinely don't want it. If I have, it tastes awful and/or I feel awful, so my caving frequency is pretty low.

* Sometimes I really really want sugar, so I eat sugar. And then feel bad and/or my brain doesn't work right for 24+ hours. So this frequency has gone down to zero.

* My sugar sensitivity is so high that previously bitter things like dark chocolate and arugula taste amazing. Cucumbers taste like watermelon and bell peppers taste like candy. 

* My food tastes really really good, so I like to eat my food. High-carb food tastes pretty bad, even the fatty stuff really isn't fatty enough (and it has all that filler). So whenever I get a wild idea to get fast food, I realize there's no point and the temptation drops.

* When I stick with this diet, I feel amazing. When I don't, I feel bad.

 So there's a lot of incentive to stick with this diet, and pretty much zero reason to break it. Instead of 2.5 years and 117lbs lost being due to discipline, dedication and willpower, it's instead the purposeful avoidance of poison because it makes me feel poisoned. And the continued enjoyment of real foods that taste really good and are rich and satisfying.",1

Thoughts about this morning's controversy,0,7w7e7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7w7e7r/thoughts_about_this_mornings_controversy/,94,1518146915.0,"I've been doing this r/keto diet for 18 months, maintaining a significant weight loss for about six months. It's absolutely the most effective way of eating I have ever done. I have no interest in periodic carb refeeds, and in fact I'm convicted it's harmful for me to do that.

I have observed that there's basically two different groups here on r/keto. There's young, typically male people who basically want want to get in better shape. They want to look better. They don't really have metabolic issues with carbohydrates, and they haven't failed at 20 attempts to lose weight in the past. They really just need to give up beer and pizza and lift heavy for a while and they will look and feel great. Let's call them group 1.

Then there's group 2 -- typically obese, with metabolic syndrome, DM2, hypertension, more typically female, although very obese men are here too, and who have an abnormal metabolic response to carbohydrates. Most of the long-term regulars on r/keto fall into this category, and most of the people offering daily advice have discovered that eating extra carbs, even in a somewhat controlled way, leads to days or weeks of crazed behavior, elevated blood sugar, and uncontrolled binging. Let's call these folks group 2.

I think group 1 would be well served to go over to r/ketogains, learn all about using carbs cyclically for cutting and gaining, and be much happier with the advice and support they would get there for cycling carb refeeds. Basically, these are people who don't want to follow the ketogenic diet as described in the FAQs, and who don't really need to. I'm pretty sure the OP this morning falls into this group.

Group 2 can very happily stay over here on r/keto, offering support for people who want to cure their carb-fueled physical issues, and who want to follow the ketogenic diet as described in the FAQs. 

How could we encourage this to happen? Is there a way to encourage people to move along to a more sympathetic board if they want to advocate for something that is other than the r/keto diet?

Thoughts on Alcohol,3,f4kg9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/f4kg9x/thoughts_on_alcohol/,19,1581850794.0,"I wasn't sure where to post this or if it deserves its own post but here goes. Before I begin, I think it is important to understand why I first started this and why I am now concerned.

I understand the thought process behind a plant based / vegan diet and that does help me make decisions when I'm at the store or restaurant... Without a cause / effect I would not care to do this. Suffice to say my motivations behind this whole thing are about feeling better, living a better healthy life, and preventing future health issues. I have noticed the difference and I've made my own decision on what scientific studies to believe. I think the reasoning behind sticking to plant based diet makes sense but one thing I'm not sure about is alcohol.

A big part of this diet is that the food we eat does not cause inflammation. I'm pretty sure most alcohol causes inflammation and other harmful effects.

If so how much inflammation does alcohol cause compared to eating a normal non vegan meal for example and if any what other harmful effects does it cause?

I would love to hear from y'all if you have any theories or know of any studies that have looked into this. I'm mostly looking for information related to alcohol counteracting the benefits of a plant based diet.

Edit: People not too happy with me. The first two articles provided in the comments. The last two articles I found to provide more information on more general harmful effects. 

Most of the responses I got just said alcohol causes cancer which is a pretty small % and most prevalent in people lacking a certain gene. White people are least susceptible. 

 Risks

* liver disease, including cirrhosis and life-threatening liver failure requiring a liver transplant
* a higher risk of high blood pressure, heart failure, and dementia
* a higher risk of certain cancers, including those of the digestive tract (including colon cancer), breast, and liver
* a higher risk of injury, especially from drunk driving and falls — homicides and suicides are also often alcohol-related
* lapses in judgement — For example, people who are drunk may engage in risky sexual behavior or use other drugs
* a higher risk of depression, anxiety, and addiction which may, in turn, affect one’s ability to establish and maintain social relationships and employment
* Alcohol poisoning — many people don’t realize that if you drink enough alcohol over a short period of time, it can be fatal
* fetal alcohol syndrome — alcohol can damage a baby’s developing brain and cause other developmental abnormalities.

""In fact, the evidence from our brain imaging studies demonstrates that alcohol is the exact opposite. Even ONE glass of beer or wine per day can be directly toxic to brain function. The SPECT scans of people who drink too much alcohol – more than three drinks a week – look toxic. Alcohol use negatively affects the brain and body in a number of ways.

It is associated with fatty liver disease, peripheral neuropathies (pain and tingling in hands, legs, and feet), damage to neurons, especially those in the cerebellum, which is involved in physical and thought coordination, and mood. It interferes with the absorption of vitamin B1, which predisposes people to serious [cognitive problems](https://www.amenclinics.com/blog/myths-hurting-memory/). Alcohol decreases firing in the [prefrontal cortex](https://www.amenclinics.com/blog/what-is-the-executive-center-of-the-brain/), the most human and thoughtful part of the brain. It also disrupts sleep.

Additionally, alcohol predisposes you to sugar abuse, stimulates your appetite, prolongs the time you sit during a meal and is associated with continued eating even though you feel full. Alcohol exerts substantial influence on the circulation in your pancreas, increasing the production of insulin, which can lead to low blood sugar levels, which worsens your decision-making.

And it gets worse. In 2015, the prestigious journal *Lancet* published a review of 115,000 subjects in which researchers found that although[ alcohol use ](https://www.amenclinics.com/blog/how-to-help-someone-struggling/)decreased the risk of heart attacks, it increased the risk of cancer and physical injuries. Alcohol is a known carcinogen and associated with 5.8% of all cancer deaths. Jürgen Rehm, Ph.D., Director of the Social and Epidemiological Research Department at the Center for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, wrote, “Very simply, the cancers that have been determined previously to be caused by alcohol have been confirmed. There is no discussion about whether alcohol causes these cancers. The fact that alcohol is a carcinogen has been clearly confirmed.”

He said how he took 14 months to be completely free from carbs. Because of his sugar addiction, he couldn't just go straight into a low carb diet, because of the cravings. He came off all grains first, and only came off sugar as well some months later. That worked for him.

While many people can jump straight in to keto cold turkey some people can't. Tim Noakes couldn't. 

If you've tried to do keto but fell off the wagon because of cravings, don't beat yourself up; it might be worth trying Tim Noakes' approach instead.

Tips for Super Fat People (Like ME!) Just Starting Out,3725,6ntcpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/6ntcpg/tips_for_super_fat_people_like_me_just_starting/,431,1500329982.0,"I wanted to write something specifically to those of us who have 100, 200, or even 300 pounds to lose, from somebody who has been there. These are things I would like to have read 75 pounds ago when I started out at 415. If these offend anyone, my bad. Feel free to add your own two cents.

1. **Everything you know about food is wrong.** I'm a reasonably intelligent, educated professional person, but I didn't know shit about food and nutrition. I thought I was eating ""healthy"" this whole time because I would get ""organic"" chips or I would eat sweet potato fries. Unfortunately, there are a lot of corporations out there that benefit from misinformation, and lots of food being touted as healthy that isn't. RESEARCH keto, HFLC, insulin, IF. YouTube, Keto subreddit, books... Google that shit, because most of what you know is wrong, or we wouldn't be this size. You're not stupid, you're mis-informed and you've been fed a lifetime of bullshit by a lot of bullshitters.

2. **You're exhausted. Push past it.** Being super fat is exhausting. You have no energy. It hurts to put on shoes and go to the store, muchless walking around reading labels. START eating right and the energy will come. When I was 415 pounds, literally even walking *killed* my lower back. It was SO much easier to get starchy, carb-filled take-out with a pint of ice cream and check out after work. Because again, you're exhausted. Don't do that. Start eating right and the energy will come, and it will come faster than you expect it to. But seriously, just fucking start. Most people who have lost a shit-ton of weight wish they'd started earlier. The literal earliest point you can start is now. Don't wait for a health scare. Don't wait to get the energy. Don't wait until your first triple bypass to finally get the motivation. The motivation will come when you're eating HFLC and the scale is going down. That shit is super fucking motivating.

3. **You will not notice body changes for a long fucking time.** I'm down 75 pounds, I still have a LONG way to go, and I'm BARELY noticing changes. All my clothes were stretchy (because I was a fucking 5x) so yes, my clothes are baggier than they were, but I'm still wearing my 415-pound clothing. Because it's all leggings and verrrryyy stretchy material. Learn to appreciate the non-""noticeable"" NSVs, like ""my back hurts less"" or ""I can walk longer distances"". Don't get discouraged if nobody notices for a while because, and I hate to say this, skinnier people spend a lot of time trying to not comment on or notice fat peoples' weight. They may feel like they're offending you by pointing it out, or they genuinely can't/don't notice a difference.

A skinny person can lose 30 pounds and it will be DRASTIC. If you're over 300 and you lose 30 pounds, you might not even be able to tell. Keep going. Keep fucking going. 

4. **The biggest battle you'll face is against hunger.** At my heaviest, I *lived* to eat. I'd eat everything I could, and I'd still always be hungry. Because of how our bodies store fat, I've heard it described something like this: ""Obese people are surrounded by layers of fat, but they're nutritionally starving inside."" Really the *only* solution I've *ever* found is keto. Before I did keto 100% I would try and up my fat intake to stay full longer, but if you're eating extra fat and still eating a shit ton of carbs, that's not gonna work. Get rid of the fucking carbs (except for vegetables, veggies are dope).

5. **Your friends will sabotage you.** Look, you're the fat friend. You're the friend your friends call when they want ice cream, pizza, cake, and they don't want to feel guilty about it because you're fatter than they are. It's shitty, but it's happened to me. Misery loves company, and the people around you will doubt/question/criticize or flat-out berate your lifestyle change. Find new friends or get real fucking good at setting good boundaries.

6. **TRACK YOUR MACROS** When I wasn't tracking my macros, I was genuinely confused about how I was so heavy. It seemed to defy physics. I would eat fruits and vegetables, and it didn't *feel* like I should be as heavy as I was until I started tracking my macros. Fuck, I was eating a lot of food. Like, a lot. A pastry with coffee. Coffee with loads of sugar. Free food. Drive-ins. So, so many calories (thousands!!!) came from source I didn't even CONSIDER until I stopped eating shitty food. If you think you can eye-ball your keto journey and ""guess"" about keeping your carbs under 20 g, congrats, you're wrong. 

One of the things I realized was that I was eating way way too much food to counter-balance the constant fatigue I felt, which actually turned out to be crazy blood sugar spikes from, ironically, all that food. It's such a vicious cycle.

7. **Stop eating out** Just stop. Restaurants and fast food joints have zero stake in your health. In fact, they benefit greatly from your dependence on them and your repeat business. Cook your own food. It sucks, it's a learning curve, but you'll save all the money and you'll *actually* see results, instead of eating fast food ""low carb"" and still ingesting 3,000+ calories a day. Keto doesn't really work if you're still eating giant, giant meals that just happen to be the *right* food. Keto is great, but it's not going to replace actual physics. Trust me, I tried living on blocks of cheese every day at first. 

8. **Figure out what works for you, and fuck the rest.** My well-meaning friends are full of advice that seems good in theory, but absolutely doesn't work for me. I've gotten good at saying, ""thanks for the advice!"" and then just doing whatever the fuck I was already doing. My advice now comes from this subreddit, YouTube videos from doctors and nutrition experts, and science-based articles and books that genuinely know how the body works, NOT from my dear, sweet older co-worker who insists that fruit is the key to true weight loss. 

Please feel free to add your own! I'm always looking for more advice from big people who've been there! KCKO!

Tips for keeping dried-goods based meals interesting?,3,jdblkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/jdblkg/tips_for_keeping_driedgoods_based_meals/,7,1603032496.0,"Hi all!

I've recently become vegetarian with the long term goal of being mostly WFPB to some degree. Work life is very busy at the moment so I'm first focusing on habituating myself to eating dried staples daily. Mostly pasta (this more as a treat), rice, barley, oats, beans, lentils, and peas. I also don't have much space to refrigerate or freeze food hence the focus on dry staples.

I've gotten into the grove with beans; I have big jars for each of dried black, pinto, soy, garbanzo (chickpeas), white navy, and kidney beans. Every day in the morning I cook in the pressure cooker a combination of 1-6 types of beans that sounds/looks good to me that day. This has proved enough variety to keep me happy eating a few cups of beans every day (6 types = 63 different possible combinations).

However whenever I try to make a grain to accompany this it's hard to get it to vary enough each day to remain satisfying. I tend to mix my rice with some lentils or peas to add flavor, and I have red and green varieties for both. But it still roughly tastes the same/has the same texture every day.

Tips for making quinoa and chia digestible?,1,aldb9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/aldb9y/tips_for_making_quinoa_and_chia_digestible/,10,1548888167.0,"I'm not new to this way of eating, and have zero problem with a lot of fiber from legumes and vegetables.

Unless I cook quinoa until mushy it causes intestinal discomfort 6-8 hours later.  
 
Chia I don't seem to digest at all even when soaked overnight. When I've counted calories in the past and used chia pudding as part of breakfast, I lose weight at an unhealthily fast rate and feel extremely hungry once it's moved down from my stomach. I have a big bag of chia still that I'd like to find a way to use. My husband has celiac, so a lot of grains are off the table or expensive to find certified gluten free (like oats). ",0

Whatever that motivator was, you’re here and we welcome you. We look forward to hearing your stories. 

It may seem overwhelming at first. Be patient with yourself. 

While you’re buying the food at Costco, the food scale is also on sale. So is the WW scale, which I think is a great one. Eventually you’ll decide you don’t want to drink your calories, so stop that nonsense whenever you’re ready. Don’t buy any clothes right now, because you’re going to be mad when you grow through them so quickly. 

I already bundled up and gave away the size 24 pants and XXXL shirts, then the 22s, XXLs, 20s, 18s, XLs, 16s, 14s, Larges, and even most of the 12s. I’m a six foot middle-aged woman now wearing some mighty cute size 10 jeans and medium sweaters. I am about to go for a three mile run. Last year I broke my foot by just walking with it. How about that?

Don’t cheat. You wouldn’t cheat on anything else, so why would you cheat with yourself? If you think you need to eat away negative feelings, the bad feelings go away with or without a binge, but you’ll be fatter and sadder if you decided to feed the feelings. This is one of the only things we get to be in complete control of, and my oh my is that awesome. 

Fifty weeks ago I was exactly where the newbies are today. I took it in steps and recommend you do too. First learning to shop and eat, then adding vitamins for general health, then weighing and paying attention to macros, then adding exercise because you’ll have so much energy. 

All things are possible with a plan, and no problem is complicated. Don’t do this for anyone else, an upcoming wedding or vacation, or because someone is making you do it with them. Once it’s for you and only you... 

Read the FAQ, read the labels, don’t cheat, avoid anything marketed “keto” and most of the “keto recipes” on the internet, and be kind to yourself with healthy choices and patience. 

Stick around this sub. There’s a ton of guidance, support, and even tough love when you need it.

Today is 1 year Keto,297,jbpc5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jbpc5e/today_is_1_year_keto/,30,1602803372.0,"I've been eating Keto for 1 year now.  5'11 39m 325#-195#.

I've lost 130#

I've self identified as a fat guy for \~25 years.  Because of this, I just accepted that it was who I was.  I've never attempted any form of dieting before this.  I decided I wanted to lose enough weight to take my nephews on roller coasters in the spring.  That would require me to lose 50# which was my initial goal.  As I hit my 50# goal in March, things got locked down and the amusement parks didn't open.  

I was doing lazy keto and just keeping a mental count of my daily net carbs.  My losses begin to slow/stop at 275#.  I decided that since Keto wasn't an inconvenience I would keep it up and I would also start tracking macros.  I discovered that my protein intake had been far too low.  I noticed that I was much weaker than I used to be.  I started putting a focus on ensuring I got adequate protein.   
 Once I got in the habit, it was extremely easy.  I learned that certain things just had to go.  Almonds/peanuts were just too calorie dense to eat.

Because I had been overweight the entirety of my adult life, I had no idea what ""normal"" is for me.  I still don't.  Every 10# I would evaluate if I wanted to continue.  One of the things that encouraged me to continue is the stories of people that gained the weight back.  I figured that could easily be me if I went back to my traditional eating habits.  I figured, if I lost another 10# that'd be that much more time I'd have if I ended up gaining back the weight.

For 11 months, I did not do any exercise.  I've recently started weight lifting and now I am focused on building muscle and reducing body fat.  I still don't know where I'll end up.",1

Starting weight: 280
Current weight: 190 

It's been quite the amazing journey of transformation over the last year. It's so crazy to reflect back on who I was a year ago and where I'm exactly one year later. Keto and intermittent fasting is not just a diet, it's very much become my lifestyle. I've struggled with my weight and binge eating for most of my adult life, and Keto was the change that allowed me to once and for all take control of my health and break free of the constant struggle with dieting and weight gain. I literally tried everything from liquid diets, to being vegan, not to mention therapy for binge eating. Keto was what made the difference and gave me the path to actually achieve the results I wanted.   


I was so insecure and unhappy being morbidly obese, it ruined my social life, held me back in my career, I was constantly discouraged and had such a negative self image. The weight loss to me hasn't just been about regaining confidence, feeling good about myself etc. it also showed me how much internal power we have. The power of discipline, resolve and drive to accomplish goals.   


I still plan on continuing my progress and shredding a few more lbs and going into maintenance mode.   
I no longer see this as just a mechanism to lose weight, to me the mental shift that occurred which I think made all the difference is that I see this lifestyle as and habit/routine. Wishing everyone part of this community lots of positive energy and success!",1
"Today is my 28th birthday , sharing some pics of my roughly 95 lb progress over the last 3.5 years. ( 320Lbs -> 225Lbs)",1775,835ogg,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/835ogg/today_is_my_28th_birthday_sharing_some_pics_of_my/,113,1520619257.0,"Pic: https://imgur.com/a/WaaBT

Today is my 28th birthday and  I'm reflecting on what a year it's been , how I've grown in so many ways and how much I haven't changed in others.
 
 I was just flipping through my phone when I came across a picture of me from three and a half years ago  that honestly surprised me . I took the pic a year before I decided to do anything with my weight and before I had even found R/ Keto so this is around my highest weight ( at one point I was 330lbs)  I had to be pushing 320 in the photo if not a little bit more and am currently hovering at about 225 with a goal weight of 180  .    
  
It's  one of those jarring situations where I see myself everyday so I don't always  appreciate how much weight I've  lost until I can do a side by side comparison between then and now. To be honest I was a little bit discouraged with my progress as of late since I gained a a good 15+ lbs during fall /  winter and just recently managed to lose  it all to begin the spring. However seeing these two pics side by side I am  reminded how I used to dream about what it would be like to just lose 10 lbs let alone as  to accomplish the weight loss that I have. My fire has been reignited.
 
I've always wanted to know what it would be like to have abs and my goal is to develop them before my 30th birthday . Thanks to Keto  I  am confident I can do it  in my 2 year window  ....eventhough as I have learned weight loss never works quite the way you plan it haha.


Thanks r/Keto   you guys  continue to be one of my favorite places on the internet your support and this community keep me inspired .",1

"Today is my birthday, I have a chronic heart/lung disease & PCOS, I'm on oxygen, I get maybe 500 steps a day & I've lost 18 pounds in 6 weeks with KETO.",2888,8r1pvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/8r1pvt/today_is_my_birthday_i_have_a_chronic_heartlung/,193,1529010607.0,"EDIT: HOLY COW!! Thank you all for the wonderful support & love! I am feeling it today! & I slept through the night last night, it's a birthday miracle! & THANK YOU FOR THE GOLD!! Mind blown.

TL:DR I was diagnosed last year with a heart disease & I can't move much anymore, but I've lost weight on Keto & I'm celebrating my birthday!

Per the custom, my story.  Today is my 37th birthday & even though my life is so weird & scary right now, I'm celebrating because I still have hope. I lost a lot of hope over the last year, 2017 was the worst year of my life. It started with a miscarriage of my first pregnancy after being infertile for over 5 years, moved to the illness & death of my wonderful mother\-in\-law, rounded third with a chronic illness and capped the year with unemployment. I mean, after all that, things HAVE to start getting better, right?

It was this time last year when I was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension & put on 24/7 oxygen. My life went downhill overnight & I was terrified that I could just keel over & die if my heart beat too hard (it literally could have). Within 6 months of my diagnosis, I was on disability leave & then let go from my job. I sold my car since I couldn't drive anymore & my husband learned how to schedule oxygen tank deliveries. I found the most epic doctors in the world (the guy who literally wrote the textbook) & we started diving into treatments. My life was now all about my heart & lungs.

My lungs have been horrible since I was a baby & it took 36 years of misery before my heart got too tired also. That's what pulmonary hypertension is, the right side of your heart is too big, for a variety of reasons. Mine was lung related & it meant that my heart won't go back down until it gets some relief or my lungs get better. They probably won't, so I may have a transplant to look forward to down the road. The oxygen is essential & I can't live without it. But that now means that I can't....do....anything that I used to, at least in the same way I used to. Going to lunch, to the movies, even to the grocery store are things that have to be scheduled, tank planning 101. It takes a toll & it's something that we think about all day long.

Along with the oxygen, my doctors also put me on a variety of medications to help ease my blood vessel pressures, with a lot of delightful side effects. Massive headaches three times a day, sinus pain, bloody noses almost daily, inability to sleep through the night, fluid gain, etc. So then I end up with new medications to help offset the side effects & the cycle continues. After a year of this, I'm also now on some lovely antidepressants, cause after all this, who wouldn't be depressed & anxious & scared to death of everything?

Adding all this together...no movement, oxygen limitations, medicine side effects...along with always being one of the fat kids, my weight spiked almost overnight. As soon as I had to stay at home, I put on 15\-20 pounds. The medications & water retention added another 10 or so. On top of all that, who wants to eat celery and carrots when you are stuck at home & super depressed & can't go anywhere? So let's throw some cakes & cookies & a shit ton of pasta & potatoes in the mix. In May, my peak weight was around 270 & I'm only 5'2''. My body was hurting & I was partially to blame.

Then, when I was at my most miserable, my fattest self, hating my clothes, hiding under a big sweater, not looking at myself in the mirror, I heard a word floating around....K\-E\-T\-O. I knew about keto, my brother\-in\-law lost a ton of weight with it a while back. & yes, I'd tried to loose weight too. I watched my calories like they were breaking the law (& only MAYBE 1200 a day – misery). I tried low carb/slow carb for so long that I was sick of beans. I tried salads for lunch & lean cuts for dinner. But nothing worked. Beyond not being able to move liked I'd used to (I actually used to go to the gym at 5am for a really long time), I also had PCOS & all the fat in the world just kept gluing itself to my stomach & belly. NOTHING WORKED. I have to weigh every day, because I'd gain 5 pounds in fluid & have to call my doctor. I would see the scale moving up & up & up & get more & more depressed.

Somehow, that crazy “K” word stuck in my brain & I started poking around & looking at groups like this one. Hmm, I love bacon & steak & pork rinds. I saw that other PCOS women were having wonderful success. So I finally talked my husband into trying it, cause he's a big guy & we started on May 8th...and boy, let me tell you how I DOVE into some bacon. I can now eat a delicious New York Strip steak & enjoy every single bite. We've been doing lazy keto & it is such a relief to not have to count every meal, every snack, every everything. I keep my carbs under 20 & if I slip up, I learn from my mistake, enjoy it & move on. I'm not caught in the anxious vortex of accidentally overeating or trying to compensate from having 2 cups instead of 1 cup. I know weight loss is 80&#37; food & 20&#37; exercise & I simply cannot do the exercise part now. But I can control the food & it's working.

Beyond the delish food part, I am more thrilled that I've actually LOST weight. For the first time in years, without having to be miserable at the gym every day or feel like a food robot, I am losing weight. My doctors are thrilled (I checked with them before I started), my clothes are feeling better & my body is starting to feel a little better. This is going to continue, because I know what I'm doing (thanks to these awesome groups!) & this is going to help my heart & lungs tremendously. And just today, I felt a jawbone. Huh, where did that guy go?

So trust me, guys, you can do this. If you're on the fence or worried about what the future changes mean or scared of kicking pasta out the door, YOU CAN DO IT! I can't even walk outside on my own, I'm on massive amounts of medication & I eat eggs, butter, cheese, meat, & cream all day every day & I've actually lost weight. I've lost pounds & inches & I'm gaining back some control over my life.

Today is my birthday & I'm celebrating with a nice slice of steak. With bacon on top.",1

First off shoutout this sub. I can’t even begin to thank you all enough. So much inspiration and knowledge what a cool community we are. 

Well today’s my ketoversary and what a year it’s been. I’ve managed to lose 170lbs (from 455 to 285) reversed pre diabetes, normalized blood pressure and cholesterol. I’m so glad I decided to try Keto (now carnivore) on a whim. It’s sure changed my life for the better. No pills, no surgery, no detox MLM companies. I just cut all the BS sugar, ate at a caloric deficit, and threw in a little bit of intermittent fasting. Ready to keep going and see it through. Here’s so pics below.

Once I was able to sort out the correct macros for sustaining lean body mass and maximizing fat loss, the fat just started to fall off.

This presented a bit of an issue I don't see a lot of discussion on in general and was hoping someone might be able to help me sort out. Essentially what seems to be happening is when I am eating enough dietary fat that my body doesn't need to access much of my body fat, I feel fine. But when a sizable amount of my calories are coming from body fat after awhile I start to feel mildly toxic.

It's almost as if the body fat is ""dirty fat"" and the dietary fat is ""clean"". Which if you think about it wouldn't be the craziest of things as I've long heard of toxics being stored in fat. It just didn't seem to matter on a practical level until we were burning ""dirty fat"" at a considerably higher rate.

Any suggestions on what if anything I could supplement with to help bind the garbage that is being disturbed when burning the dirty fat?",1

Transformation (non keto + keto),47,jg3h7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jg3h7o/transformation_non_keto_keto/,16,1603414448.0,"In late 2015, I was 36 years old and in bad shape. I'd ended up at 310 lbs (6'2), on the cusp on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease with high blood pressure and triglycerides through the roof. I had been diagnosed with mild sleep apnea. I wasn't exercising. I wasn't paying attention to what I was eating. And I had no idea where to start. My doctor told me I needed to get under 250 and he would stop giving me grief if I got there. 

So in January of 2016, I started walking a couple miles a day. And that grew to three miles a day and sometimes five or six miles a day and then became mixed with some jogging. Over the course of 2016, I lost about 35 lbs with no dietary changes and held 275 lbs for the next few years.

In May of 2019, I met my girlfriend. She made the remark one day that if, on any given day, she didn't go to the gym, I couldn't come over and hang out. So I thought, hey, I turn 40 in a few months, it would be great if I could lose those 25 lbs and be under 250 for my birthday. She was in way better shape than I was anyway. So I stepped up the workouts to include pretty intense hour long elliptical sessions with incline. I did some strength training too. I started paying attention to my diet and didn't really start dieting, but I started making smarter choices. And a couple days before my 40th, I hit 245 and I maintained that weight loss as well.

In January this year, gf said she wanted to lose 30 lbs and she was going to start keto. I had always been super skeptical of low carb diets, but decided that I liked eating with her enough to try it with her (we ended up settling on strict keto, no wheat, no soy, no trans fats, very little in the way of processed foods at all). I set my final goal weight at 215 lbs, about halfway between my weights at 22 and 25. And by mid March when everyone went into quarantine, I had hit 215 lbs at 40 years old.

But keto had other ideas and by the end of May I had settled out at about 185 lbs. I went to the doctor in July and all of my bloodwork was perfect. My cholesterol and triglycerides were down. My HDL was up. My liver enzymes were in check. My A1C was still normal. I weighed in at 187 that day and the doc and I had a good laugh about ""under 250."" Since May, I've been consistently weighed in between about 183 and 187 on any given day. I've lost 11 inches in my chest, 12"" in my waist, 3"" around my neck. I'm wearing loose fitting 32"" jeans and have gone from 3XL or 2XLT to a size Large shirt.

Today, I weighed in at 181.2, a new low at 41 years old. Oh, and she's lost 38 lbs on keto too.

TL;DR. Lost 65 lbs without keto and then lost another 64 lbs on keto. Changed my life.",1

I'm looking for some pointers on how to transition from a processed vegan diet to a plant based vegan diet. I've been vegan for about 2.5 years now, was vegetarian for 10 years prior to that, and have been really proud of my commitment. Unfortunately, my transition to veganism has not been the healthy transformation that most think of with this diet. I'm a huge carb lover, and enjoy my chips, bread, potatoes, and pasta. I'm also a ""grazer"" and enjoy snacking all day versus only eating during set meal times. With my current eating habits, I've continued to gain weight even without all the meat, eggs, and cheese. I'm ready to make a change, but really struggle with meal preparation and finding time to cook meals every day.

Additionally, I live with my husband and grandfather who I cook dinners for. They are not vegan/vegetarian but do eat what I make (mostly). My meals usually involve a vegan base or sides and then separate entrées, i.e. chicken and dumplings, with the soup and dumplings vegan but I split the recipe in half do one has chicken and one has vegan chicken.

I'm a social worker and work 50 hours a week. My days are unpredictable - sometimes I can get off early around 4:00 PM and other days I'll be at work until 8:00 PM. I don't often have a lunch break, so I usually eat at my desk.

Drank 7 or 8 of em over the course of a few days (company drank the rest). Bought a new one tonight, and before I got it open I noticed it wasn't diet. White package like the rest of the diet drinks seem to be in. Whew, I caught it. Until I checked the empty box from they either night. Flippin regular soda. 

2 days I was blowing my plans all to hell and not even noticing. I felt like a total dipshit and had a good round of pissed off about it. But back on track, lesson learned, keeping on. 

Worst thing is I had blood work done today to check my electrolytes and they came back good, so I thought I was kicking ass on this. Dunno how much a few days off soda could have screwed THAT up. Any opinions on that? I have dilated cardiomyopathy, so getting those right is really important lol. 

Anyway, I appreciate this sub and all you guys do. I'm certain you have changed my life for the better and are helping to give my kids a long, awesome life with their dad :) 

Lss: drank regular soda a few days before my blood work, how bad will that skew the good electrolytes report I got?

When I say I didn't notice, I meant that I was drinking regular soda. I def felt all sorts of off yesterday and last night, could sleep, heart palps, big-time tummy troubles. I still didn't connect any dots, but I knew something was going on. I thot I was catching the puking bug my kids and wife had this week. ",1

Got to 261 during lockdown and decided to go for it. I’ve always lost weight on Keto but put it back on just as rapidly. I think because I didn’t track calories, so when I strayed and the calorie load was high- boom - weight back on.

So I tried lower calorie keto and food journaling. I’m losing 2 pounds a week if exercise zero. 4 pounds plus if I exercise at all. Turkey and Turkey Bacon are my new friends. Sugar free jello, low fat cheese sticks, etc. 80-100 ounces of water minimum.

It’s now or never as I’m within 5 years of my father and grandfathers multiple heart attack path. I’ve started introducing salads, fruits- blackberries, raspberries, blueberries. A cup of black berries and heavy cream at night instead of DQ Blizzards, Desserts of every kind, etc. 

I feel great, my blood work came back with drastic lowering of triglycerides, my cholesterol was never too high but it lowered as well.

I seriously hope I can keep the weight off as I eat 1200-1500 calories a day. 

I’m rarely hungry, found a great veggie protein powder and add it to my coffee. Lots of chili but I use lean beef when I can.

Type 1 diabetic on keto - this must be illegal somehow,1815,8g7sh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/8g7sh4/type_1_diabetic_on_keto_this_must_be_illegal/,326,1525203655.0,"First post on Reddit. From cell phone with over eager danish auto correct. You've been warned...

30 year male diabetic here. Diagnosed at 12. Never achieved proper stable sugars and been slowly dying. Very litterally. I know you might not all have type 1 diabetes, but I kindda need to share this. It says a lot about keto for diabetics/non-diabetics alike. Know any type 1's? Please beat them with a piece of bacon until they start googling type 1 + keto.

With that out of the way, here's a LONG wall of text after only one week of quite strict keto...

According to what I've been told by doctors and one  dietrist after another for 18 years, I should be dead or dying right now. I am in ketosis (2.5/moll - got all the tools to measure and not in ketoACIDOsis -20+- which equals death rather quick). I used to take 34 slow acting units of insulin, 10-30ish units of fast acting. I now take 19 slow and zero(!) fast acting units of insulin. Measurements are different from the States but a non-diabetic here in Denmark should be around 4 and 7.5. At 3.8 you become symptomatic of hypoglycemia (personal record 0.5). Over 8 could be insulin resistance/early type 2 and at 10 hyperglycemia symptoms start for real(I have been at 45 multible times). I'm at 5.0 consistently now. No jumps... I'm used to 18 years of lousy sleep due to extreme highs and lows in blood glucose, now I can't sleep for more than four hours. I now do heavy lifting 2+ hours a day after 18 years of no exercise. Not out of vanity or for the health benefits but because it feels like I'm on speed and the not legal kind (never done drugs besides 4/20 but this must be what those sort of stimulants feel like). Again none of the usual 15-20+ bloodsugars induced by exercise.

I know I'm in it for life. The massive jump in sugar control means many more years alive and without  them being with blindness, amputation, renal faliure and the list goes on. Quality of life. I dislike most carbs because they have been forced on me and hurt my body every time since childhood. No artificial  sweetener can trick my brain into secreeting insulin. Not stress, stomac line epansion, visual stimulation or xfactors can do that. Only me. I'm in complete control for the first time in my life. I eat once a day. Purely because I'm not hungry. I'm feeling full all the time because of my fatty meals and fiber from my veggies. 

The keto flu is something that hit me. For a non diabetic I'm positive it can feel like being hit by a truck. For a type 1? I don't want to deminish what you are going through but... Compare it to a professional athlete being asked to do ten push ups. He would find it comedic. I guess I am an athlete of discomfort because of type 1 so zero problems there. What regular people would have sit down and litterally sweat/semi-collapse over for 20 minutes I fail to realize because I am so used to it already.

Before farming and civilization what did we humans eat? Fruit did not grow together in huge fields but perhaps you were lucky enough to find a tree during fall. The fruits would be a lot smaller, less sweet and fewer of them on the tree. There was no consistent source of carbs and we did not need them. We still don't except for a tiny bit for the brain that we get naturally in a keto diet. In the last century we have gone from recommending 20 percent carbs to sometimes 60+. We don't need to get deep into the type 2 epidemic to start being concerned about a connection. America has demonstated this with its food lobbys pushing poison and here in europe we are catching up to them in weight and type 2.

Whether diabetic or not: 
If you are on keto, continue. If not, start. If you know a diabetic, tell them about keto. To us, it's not about weight, health benefits but purely survival. It's not about ""healthy lifestyle"" it's just about staying alive.

I'm a journalist not a doctor, so while I do thorough research I'm no expert and your type 1 treatment needs are going to be different. During my start I measured glucose every half hour. 

I have not had a high or low reading since starting. How could I? My tiny dose of slow insulin keeps me stable and deals with/feeds my brain with the 5-10 grams of carb I get from vegetables. How could that ever become a life threatening diabetic shock again? How could my bloodsugar get incredible high without carbs? 

This was just my early experiences but I feel keto should be shouted from the rooftops to all diabetics. It is not healthy vs unhealthy it is life vs death/permanent disability.

Think I got it all out of my system now...

Hello! I updated the flawed previous image!Sadly, as i am not a graphic designer in any shape or form, i could not foresee the many problems i encountered. This lead to the final image being a bit hard to read, but oh well. I sank 15 hours into it, and redoing everything would take the same amount so, this is it for now.

I like to believe that i took the advice from the previous thread and fixed the problems that it had. It became a more informational and more correct image, but then again i am repeating myself, it became hard on the eyes and a bit complex. Also, with the introduction of categories, the text became harder to read (yet still readable on modern displays). During the making of this, i noticed that the site i used for the nutritional information probably isn't the best choice, but i hope and believe that it is close enough for it to not matter.

Anyways, its resolution is 12,000 x 7,000 so zooming shouldn't be a problem. I will provide a link to the full image (40mb) in the comments as posts get tagged as ""spam"" if they have more than 1 link in them.

I hope that you like it and find it useful despite its flaws!

Edit : :OOOOOO I forgot to rearrange the chinese cabbage. Since there are like 3 different types, i summed them up between raw and cooked and i got a new value. Then i forgot to move it and now the carbs go from 2,1 -> 1 -> 2,7 . Ooft.

Edit 2 : The grams of carbs are \*net carbs\*.Edit 3 : I should've added a flame symbol next to the meat category + possibly consider making a version with grams of protein/fat instead of %.Also, obligatory thank you for the silver and gold. Not really sure what they do but hey! Thanks again!

Edit 4 : This is not an ""eat only these"" guide. Its purpose is to cover the basics. I might have missed a thing or two but i will never be able to fit every food in it. You can always check the nutritional values of items you like but are not in this image.

Also, the values are not per serving size, they are per 100 grams across all items. Yes, for example, you arent supposed to eat 100g of nuts, but you can always calculate from the numbers i have provided. 100 grams are 0.220lbs.

Edit 5: Thank you to all for the kind words! I try and respond to the more interactive comments but upvoting really isnt enogh for the people who are thankful. Thanks to you for taking the time to check this out and write me a comment! Cheers!  


Edit 6 : The eggs' values for protein and fats % are reversed. There is a possibility that there are 1-2 more items that have the same issue. It is not a gigantic problem, but i will fix them and post an updated picture with other small tweaks needed to be done. Sorry for the inconvenience!",1

Than at 3:20pm, I was like, I should eat lunch, but not because I was hungry, but because I hadn't stopped all day.  So I ate a bit of the lunch I brought, but was full after about a 1/4 of it.  I didn't even eat dinner.  So I woke up this morning at 4:30am ravenous.

But yesterday I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jf0byk/had_one_of_the_shittiest_days_of_my_life_ate/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), saying it was the shittiest day of my life. Lost my AirPods Pros, thought that was bad. Then my (ex) girlfriend went to her mother's house because she was pissed. Then I lost my dog due to fucking xylitol. 

Guess what? Life ain't done with me yet.

The urgent care vet? Wants $4620 dollars for the operation and ""care"" for my dog. I have no idea how I'm going to pay that. 

My girlfriend? Was upset over me being depressed because MY FUCKING DOG DIED. Broke up with her, on the spot. I don't know why the hell I was dating that sociopath.

Work? Last thing I want is to do right now is paperwork. But I'm so broke I can't even afford to take vacation days. And they won't give me a single day of paid leave. 

I've put Trevor (my dog), into my freezer. It felt SO WRONG. I can't even open it. I want to bury him in a coffin, but I can't afford one. I don't even have a backyard to bury him in. My parents advised me to just bury him in a park or cremate him... But he was one of my best friends, family even. I wouldn't bury my dad, or even a distant cousin in a cardboard box. Why would I do that to Trevor? But I don't know. I'm so confused right now.

I guess since this is r/keto, I'll say this. Yesterday night, I didn't technically cheat. I drank a lot of whiskey though. Today I haven't eaten anything. I just feel sick to the stomach. 

Life's fucked up. Diets probably not doing great. Don't know if I can even stay financially afloat. Not sure why I'm posting in r/keto , but I guess the only reason I can think of is because I feel like this is a community I'm a part of? And I need to share my problems with SOMEONE.

I want to take a week off, and visit family. But can't afford that. I want to speak to a counselor, but can't. But mostly, I want to go back a day in time. When my biggest concern was a lost AirPod, and I was more focused on what I was going to have for dinner than anything else.",1

I could weigh the beer before i mix the powder in, then again with the powder in to subtract that weight, then after marinating the steaks weigh how much is left over and divide that by two (since one is my roommates)

would that give me an accurate carb count?",1

My girlfriend (who doesn't have reddit) has been vegan for around a year (with a break or two), and she has been having a lot of health issues. I'm just wondering if anyone has had anything similar and could lend me some advice? I don't necessarily think it's related to veganism, but it's the easiest box to investigate before we think about doctors (again) and hospitals etc. I'll explain her symptoms... Which are all variable and fluctuate in frequency and intensity, she might be fine for two weeks then it's back and terrible etc.

This has been happening for about 5-6 months now.

- Extreme stabbing stomach pain, sometimes spreading to back pain etc
- Migraines
- Dizziness
- Feeling faint
- Shakey hands
- Fuzzy head

Tests she has had done:

- MRI
- Ultrasound
- Blood
- Urine
- Stool

All said nothing was wrong. One doctor believed it was some sort of parasite or worm or something, can't remember, but he gave us the specific pill for that which is 100% effective against that thing, and nothing changed.

Now, she has had anxiety issues before which she is no longer medicated for (was on SSRIs if anyone has been on them and this sounds familiar too...) and therefore the last two symptoms are easily explained by that, but I put them in just in case they sound familiar to anyone. Other than that she's just on the regular birth control pill and that's it, fit and healthy except for this.

We are very excited to see anyone's responses. Hopefully this sounds familiar to someone and there is an easy fix, it's impacting on her life a lot.",0

Let me preface this by saying I hope this is an adequate forum to raise this question - but if there is a better place for it please direct me there. For full disclosure I'm not a vegan but have been moving closer and closer to it so far this year (no meat in May, which is a small start).

What I'm curious about is often I see lots of people quoting scientific studies on how a vegan diet is the only one proven to reverse certain illnesses and stuff, and obviously I'm not disputing that at all. During those studies it seems the comparison is ""Vegan v typical American diet"". I'm not American, but I'm from the UK so culturally and diet wise it's not too different. But is there any literature out there on the difference, from a health perspective, between a whole foods vegan diet and a whole foods plant based diet that contains a small amount of cheese/eggs/meat/etc.?

Any advice would be much appreciated.

Thank you!",0
Veganism Can Help to Prevent Zoonotic Diseases,447,fy2tkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/fy2tkv/veganism_can_help_to_prevent_zoonotic_diseases/,48,1586502668.0,"**Introduction**

The current coronavirus pandemic has caused heated discussions around the world about what caused it, whether we did enough to contain it, and how to prevent things like this from happening again. The source of the outbreak is believed to have originated in a ‘wetmarket’ in Wuhan, China.

**Source**: [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/25/what-coronavirus-covid-19-start-grow-outbreak-pandemic-health/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/25/what-coronavirus-covid-19-start-grow-outbreak-pandemic-health/)

In a vegan world the likelihood of zoonotic diseases being transmitted to humans and global pandemics is greatly reduced. There are many other benefits to a vegan lifestyle, including ethical, environmental, health, and social reasons. See this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/a2936b/why_you_should_go_vegan_ultimate_facts_and/) for more information.

&#x200B;

**Zoonosis**

A zoonosis (plural zoonoses, or zoonotic diseases) is an infectious disease caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites that spread from non-human animals (usually vertebrates) to humans. Examples of major modern diseases that are zoonoses include Ebola, salmonellosis, and HIV.

Zoonotic diseases are very common, both in the United States and around the world. Scientists estimate that more than 6 out of every 10 known infectious diseases in people can be spread from animals, and 3 out of every 4 new or emerging infectious diseases in people come from animals. Because of this, CDC works 24/7 to protect people from zoonotic diseases in the United States and around the world.

**The ’Spanish Flu’ of 1918**

The Spanish flu, also known as the 1918 flu pandemic, lasted from January 1918 to December 1920, it infected 500 million people—about a quarter of the world's population at the time. The death toll is estimated to have been anywhere from 17 million to 50 million, and possibly as high as 100 million, making it one of the deadliest epidemics in human history. Some researchers have theorised that it originated in a hospital camp in Étaples in France. The overcrowded camp and hospital was an ideal site for the spreading of a respiratory virus. **It also was home to a piggery, and poultry was regularly brought in for food supplies from surrounding villages. Oxford and his team postulated that a significant precursor virus, harbored in birds, mutated and then migrated to pigs kept near the front.**

**Antibiotic Resistance**

Antimicrobial resistance has become a major threat to public health globally with approximately 700,000 people a year dying from antimicrobial-resistant infections. The Review on Antimicrobial Resistance report predicted this will reach 10 million deaths a year by 2050 if no action is taken now.

A major cause of antibiotic resistance is animal agriculture, so going vegan is a great way to combat against this.

**Conclusion**

Going vegan is one of the best and quickest ways to reduce further outbreaks and may potentially prevent millions of lives being lost from avoidable, deadly pandemics that may occur in the future.

Vegans that are outraged by the assertion that plant-based diets can reverse disease,37,6qzv9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/6qzv9y/vegans_that_are_outraged_by_the_assertion_that/,30,1501655678.0,"I've been eating a plant-based diet for over 7 years, and I've noticed this trend from time to time on social media and in real life. For instance, there is a local vegan athlete who recently went HAM over the recent Netflix documentary ""What the Health,"" and posted a link to some screed denouncing it.  I perused it and noticed several logical fallacies (including Straw Man) and at least one factual inaccuracy about the film.  I'm not saying the film was perfect, and I may look into it more, but I thought it did a decent job discussing the health benefits of plant-based diets after viewing it once.

My working theory is that some vegans feel that, when they became vegan for ethical reasons, they made a sacrifice in their diet and lifestyle, and are depriving themselves for the sake of animal welfare.  When we claim the *opposite* - that plant-based diets are actually *healthier* than omnivorous diets - they get defensive and lash out. Since plant-based diet are not yet prominent, mainly due to industry pressure to maintain the status-quo, they can constantly fall back on confirmation bias and the bandwagon/ appeal to authority fallacies, etc.

To the best of my knowledge (correct me if I'm wrong, with links please) there is no evidence that vegetables are required for a low-carb/ketogenic diet. Eat them if you like them, so long as you stick to the low-carb options. Skip them if you like.

Either way, if you are worried about missed nutrients you may take daily multivitamins. Might be smart.

Is this a big problem? I must emphasize that I am not hungry or depriving myself. I can't imagine wanting to eat more, but as a fatty and food addict, sure, I could add a few hundred calories a day just for fun.

I’ve also had some muscle cramping while doing certain physical activities. I have family that has lost substantial weight on Keto and I will readily admit I eat “dirty” Keto 2-4x a week. Am I missing some vitamins or something else causing more intense cravings and cramping, or am I just getting bored with my foods?

I’m looking for possible supplements or thoughts on why my cravings (for like, potato chips in particular) are suddenly more intense and I’m not getting rid of the cravings with meat/cheese like I used to.

WFPB and Keto overlap?,2,auq0od,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/auq0od/wfpb_and_keto_overlap/,27,1551155859.0,"Tl;DR: Are there foods that are both keto and WFPB compliant that I can make work for entertaining guests? 

Hi all! I had a difficult situation last night, and I could use some help. 

Last night we had friends over, and after I'd made some kale chips, roasted garbanzo beans, and started on sweet potato quesadillas, one friend reminded me he was on the keto diet.

Oh no.  

They had mentioned it in passing when we saw them Friday night, but I'd completely forgotten. We'd also mentioned to them that we were doing WFPB, so we had eaten before their casual get together. We didn't expect them to offer WFPB-compliant snacks, though to our delight they had some berries.

I felt like such an ass. Hostess fail. My husband had been out most of the day and arrived just as I realized the problem.

I know very little about the keto diet other than it seems the polar opposite of WFPB. I'm mentally racing through the ingredients we have in the house, but since I'd planned grocery shopping for Tuesday, supplies were dwindling.

Me: How about red beans and rice?

Him: No beans on keto. (This also means that the roasted garbanzos are out.)

Me: You can have veggies, right?

Him: Yes. Low carb ones. No sweet potatoes.

Me to myself: Well fuck! (I had leftover sweet potato and kale soup, but that was also out.)

My husband and I rounded up items that would satisfy his hunger, but would definitely be less than satisfying overall: nuts, pumpkin seeds, olives, sauerkraut. It was a hideous mix, and I was embarrassed. 

The next time they come, I'll buy some cheese and cured meats. I have no problem serving people what they want, and I can resist the temptation. Are there food items, especially snacks or finger foods, that fit in the Venn diagram intersection of keto and WFPB?",0

So I did the math to see if that is true.  The result surprised me.

&#x200B;

The World Health Organization's reference (safe) protein:energy ranges are

* 0.094 to 0.128 for light physical activity
* 0.083 to 0.113 for moderate physical activity
* 0.057 to 0.075 for heavy physical activity

&#x200B;

According to Dr. Campbell, a WFPB diet for most people is 8-12% protein.

&#x200B;

Comparing the numbers, the logical conclusion is:

WFPB eaters that are not ""heavy physical activity"" and eat 8% protein are not safe from protein deficiency.

Hence it is important for WFPB eaters to engage in heavy physical exercise.

Alternatively, if they don't exercise enough, they should be very careful to eat enough high-protean foods.

&#x200B;

For example, (remember a WFPB diet for most people is 8-12% protein)

* a light physical activity male, age 40, needs 9.8% protein to be safe
* a moderately physical activity female, age 40, 10.3% protein to be safe

&#x200B;

WFPB is ideal for hunter-gathers, laborers, and the rural Chines farmers that Campbell studied.

Their high-energy needs insures that they eat enough food to cover protein needs.

But office work is less physical activity, need to eat less food, so WFPB safe protein intake is precarious.

Is that right?  Maybe I am missing something.

&#x200B;

Why don't WFPB advocates warn people about protein intake for sedentary workers?

I am thinking maybe I should eat more high-protein plants, but I was hoping to avoid protein counting.

it practically impossible to even design a diet of whole plant foods that’s sufficient in calories, but deficient in protein.

&#x200B;

Answer:

The answer is buried near the end of this thread.  Here it is ...

The only plausible explanation I can think of is:

Campbell's  WFPB 8% protein comes from heavy-physical-activity farmers in rural China that eat a monotonous diet of a low-protein plant.  That's what they ate because that's all they had on the farm and that's all they could afford.

But Campbell's and Gregor's target audiences are wealthy city folk that would never eat a monotonous diet.  Which almost guarantees that their WFPB diet would be over 10% or 12% protein.

We consider 8% protein low, but as kiki224c suggested, this is without a safety margin.",0

And mention periods and defecation.*

&#x200B;

I’ve always been slim.

As a teenager I would scarf down a chocolate bar for lunch, chase it down with a soda and then joke that I was “maintaining my feminine figure”.. Yeah, I was an annoying little twerp. Most teenagers are. I’m told it’s glandular.

Then I became an adult, and sure, my hips grew a little and my C cup turned into DD's, but my waist was still there and an hourglass figure like that is nothing to scoff at. I still ate what I wanted and since I was happily (and proudly) working myself half to death at the time, I hardly had the presence of mind to do anything else.  I reached a weight of 90 kg (to my 175 cm) and promptly upped my amount of exercise to 10 hours a week, cut away fast food and voilà: Down to my perfect 78 kg again. Because who needs sleep or calories when you can be slim?

Now, I am aware that the outdated and highly fallible voice of BMI would tell me that I am still overweight at 78 kg, but my collar bones were sharply marked and I had NO rolls of fat ANYWHERE, so I maintain that it was a good weight for me. I may have been thin-fat, but that is beside the point of what I am getting to.

Then the stress got to me. I won’t get into the circumstances – as that would make this long ass tale drag on even longer! – I’ll just remind everyone that you are not your jobs! And status is worth nothing if you don’t have your health.

And at 32 years I got sick. Like, ***REALLY*** sick. I’ve battled bouts of stress induced depression since I was 14 years old, but had never really had it looked into. It had always been ignored as teenager weltschmertz, laziness or something just as easily dismissed. But it was real and had never been treated, and now it was back with a vengeance. Turns out that if you ignore mental health that way, it gets worse. Huh. Who knew??

I was put on Citalopram, sent to a therapist and told to be patient; because mental health is like broken bones. If you put strain on the injured limb before it is healed, you will make it worse and possibly cripple yourself for life.

And who better to judge when I was healthy again than me?

In a completely unforeseen turn of events, it was not me.

When you have lived with on/off depression since before you became an adult, you don’t know what *“normal”* and *“healthy”* feels like. I got back to the point I were at before my breakdown and decided I was good. So I found a job. In the same business and as the same thing I did before. And I got sick. Again. (Sounds kind of obvious when I put it like this).

And this is when my body kind of started pouting. I had convinced it I was incapable of making the right decisions (true) and we were going to starve to death (huh??) so it piled on the weight. AND IT JUST KEPT PILING ON THAT WEIGHT!

My knee went, couldn’t keep up. I was sick with flu and colds every few months. I was always tired, to the point where I frequently slept 14-18 hours at a time. My cholesterol was inching towards alarming numbers. I was ashamed of my body when I could no longer shop clothes in regular stores, but had to go to “Big Girl” stores (why is it that we women are stripped of our sexuality and reduced to “girls” when we are obese?!), and I could feel people judging me as much as I judged myself when eating or simply walking on the streets. I was fat.

Now, the timeline here is something like: 28 years = 78 kg and top form! 38 years = 116 kg and, well, not so much.

Then one day, around mid-July 2018 I was reading a book on nutrition. I do that periodically, since my career was nutritionally based and it is still a hobby of mine. I’ve given up that career and am now hired as a sometimes personal assistant by a decision scientist, and that pays the bills and leaves me plenty of time for myself. My head is working now, but still fragile. Stress of any magnitude and type will send me spiraling. I have accepted this as my new normal, and I’ll wager that I am a lot happier in my everyday life now, than I ever was back when.

The book I was reading was “Why we get fat and what to do about it” by Gary Taubes. Books on the science of weight gain had been vacuumed down by me these past years like white truffles by a Piedmontian hog. I knew I had plenty of self-discipline, because that was what broke me in the first place! But still I ended up eating like my life depended on every bite even when knowing I shouldn’t. It had to be instinct, brain chemistry or genetics. Something! And Taubes had excellent points, points that could readily be looked up in the sources he provided. So I read on in literature referenced or recommended and ended up following a rabbit trail of Jimmy Moore, Robb Wolf and Jason Fung all the way to Keto.

When I was halfway through “Why we get fat” I put down the book, looked up sources, references, called a few academics, bought books to cross reference with, and then bogged down to read again. About 50 pages later I got up, threw out all sugar and sugary foods as well as all our bread and flour. I then went on reading. I may have poured out my half-drunk soda too. The knowledge I was gaining on what sugar did to my body was making me feel nauseated. I could recognize *SO MANY* symptoms of insulin resistance!  And please note that this was knowledge I in my almost 20 year career as a chef and baker had never encountered other than thinly referenced and then dismissed!

I should here mention that I am on the Asperger spectrum. I have it easy compared to others as I am extremely well adjusted but I do still get obsessive about subjects. I “fall in love” with projects and live and BREATHE for them! This became one of those. I did nothing but read science, theory and the experiences of people on keto for a week. Sleep is not really a priority in those instances. Of course I was prepared. I could not fail. I had everything lined up. I had bough bacon and eggs a plenty. Broccoli and cauliflower. I bought extra supplements: potassium, magnesium and salt tablets which we would take to mitigate the flu.

A week later we (my extremely supportive bf and me) had gone from tentative but enthusiastic low carb into full blown keto. I thought I was well prepared. I had read up on EVERYTHING I could find!

In yet another completely unforeseen turn of events, I was NOT prepared.

Dear lord, the keto flu. And the FUCKING sugar withdrawals! I was ***SHAKING***! And my beautiful vegan bf who chose to go (non-vegan) keto to support me? Funny how a stomach that hasn’t encountered red meat in 8 years will react when you eat a load of it suddenly and with no warning. And the headaches! Then our skin broke out everywhere trying to flush out toxins and we were, frankly, peeing out both arse and, well, where you normally pee from.

We were completely utterly miserable.

But like I earlier mentioned, I do self-discipline quite well. So does he. And we persevered. I bought ox-bile enzyme tablets for my poor bf whose stomach **seriously** didn’t recognize red meat as a food-stuff! And for myself, whose stomach rejected all fat to the point where I knew to just sit there on the toilet and wait, exactly half an hour after eating. Might as well. Other option was Disaster Pants.

I bought bone-broth and coconut oil to fix our fucked up digestive system (I could make the broth myself, but I will choose store bought over “I SHOULD be doing this, but probably won’t” any day).

I bought psyllium husk capsules to put a stopper in our sad ragged arses when nothing else worked (No, we ate them. What is wrong with you people!)

I also bought sweeteners, and BOY let me tell you! That is a whole fragging science unto itself! I am, as mentioned, a trained pro in nutritional stuff. As in, I am a Chef and have worked as a head chef for years in nice places. I am also a pro trained Danish Baker (not TM but it almost should be with the harrowing workhours and the sexual harassment from a male based prehistoric workforce). I know a lot of shit about food and the making there of. But cooking and baking with sweeteners? I have grey hairs now I did NOT have a year ago and I am certain this is the cause! It will NOT act the way sugar does! As a perfectionistic slightly obsessed chef and baker, I have not been happy with the recipes out there, let me tell you! I have – after a year’s hard work - perfected enough recipes that I am more or less happy now, though.

I digress. I do that a lot. I’m told it’s charming.

The point is: We slowly figured it out. And no matter how miserable the first week was for my bf, and the first month was for me (yeah, I really hit the jackpot on the horrors of starting keto) we finally had ketosis. Eureka. And the weight started peeling off. Because it works.

It’s now been a year of lazy keto (we went for maintainable over effective to make sure I didn’t grow tired of the regime, food is life for me). I’ve lost 30 kg and am at 86.2 kg now. I’ll probably lose more, and that’s great. If I don’t, that’s great too. I am damned proud of the body I have now, because I have worked hard for it!

In the year that went, IF started happening all by itself, and we now only eat between 12 and 20; usually one big meal with some light snacking here and there because we like it that way. I’ve done a few longer fasts, because I was curious about it, and it was cool. A week with only water, tea, broth and electrolytes are totally doable, but not really for me. Nice to know I can if I need to, though.

We also started working out again. My knee can finally support me, and I need to put on some muscle to fill out my skin. Which has generally snapped back beautifully, except for on my arms. Guess I’ll just have to hulk all out on them gains for that, then.

Has it been all roses, sunshine and ribeye steaks since we got through the keto flu? Fuck no. I’ve fallen in a couple of times. Planned and unplanned. But I learn from it every time. I find what triggered the unplanned mess up and learn to handle that better or avoid it. And for the planned slips, I learned from my body’s reaction to carbs.

I love carbs. Carbs love me. But we have an unusually toxic relationship of the kind where someone will in the end come to grief. And I’m pretty sure it is me. So we’ve broken up and I am never going back. Sure, we can be friends. I can do low carb. But only in the company of people I trust and in well-lit public places.

&#x200B;

**The promised TL;DR**

Remember that this is all stuff that worked FOR ME and the bf. YMMV. Some of it is just opinions. Ignore if you don’t like them.

* Don’t talk about keto to people unless they ask. (I'm told this should be the first rule?)
* Either read up on the why and how keto works, (like, why you should eat cruciferous veggies and not bananas), or follow a proven and acclaimed keto diet guide. I recommend the one in Jimmy Moore’s Keto Clarity. Don’t half ass it, you may actually harm yourself if you do.
* Buy potassium, salt and magnesium GLYCERATE. NOT CITRATE! That is a laxative in the amounts you will need it!
* Don’t force yourself to eat. Also don’t force yourself to fast unless you know what you are doing. IF will often happen all on its own when your body is ready for it. If you are curious on fasting, please read up on it first, for your own sake.
* Drink your water. I personally need 2-2.5 liters a day. I have a dedicated Water Glass that I know the measurements of, and I know I need to fill and drink it 4-5 times a day.
* Guess what else can be used for a laxative? Salt in large amounts, is what. Space it out during the day or Disaster Pants will happen.
* Read the ingredients list on everything you buy. I was shocked to find that they put dextrose (sugar) in pâté! Seriously?! And some mayo has it to!! (I RAGED at that. Mayo should only be egg yolk, salt, vinegar and oil!!!!!!! Raaaaah!) You may have to google your way around some of the sneaky names they give ingredients to make them seem friendlier or unrecognizable but take the time. It pays off.  (Aaand how about the number of names for sugar, huh? 61 and – probably - counting: [https://sugarscience.ucsf.edu/hidden-in-plain-sight/#.XUrsKDtMSUk](https://sugarscience.ucsf.edu/hidden-in-plain-sight/#.XUrsKDtMSUk))
* Having bad cravings? Suck on a piece of Himalaya salt. Drink some coffee or tea. Give your mouth something to taste and do. If it gets really bad, I make myself a cup of bone broth or just go ahead and make the meal of the day if I haven’t eaten already. I you have eaten and the cravings are this bad, then odds are you have had too many carbs somehow or didn’t get enough protein.
* Period on keto: It will be messed up. Hormones got trapped in the fat you stored on your body, and then gets into your bloodstream when you lose it. But it will sort itself out in time. I’m personally almost back to the flow, cramps and schedule I had a sixteen. For better or worse (ouch!)
* Readymade store bought keto food stuffs. Yeah, no. Not for me. Low carb protein bars tried to kill me a couple of times (#AlwaysCheckForMaltitol, #NeverForget, #IWasWarnedButDidntListen, #VigilForMyBum) and usually the other stuff I find still has way too many carbs, just disguised. They’ll sneak it in there somehow, because carbs are cheap fillers that make your reptile brain yell for more. I’ve learned to make my own stuff or go without.
* Sweeteners are your enemy. They will lull you into a false sense of security then either give you carb-cravings or make you spray paint the inside of the toilet. Don’t trust them.
* Have a backup plan for when you don’t want to or can’t cook. Find somewhere that makes lettuce wrap burgers or no bread sandwiches or something. Stock up on pork rinds. Have cheese in bulk in the fridge, whatever works for you. But do have a plan B. I’ve learned the hard way to have a huge supply of macadamia nuts and pork rinds for the days when cooking. Is. Not. Happening.
* Screw ketones. If you have been eating low enough carbs for a month or more you are DEFINITELY in ketosis. More ketones will not make you more in ketosis. It is a switch, not a scale. Spending money on keto-sticks and stuff like that is only relevant if you are diabetic and also need to measure blood sugar to make sure you don’t enter ketoacidosis. But if you ARE diabetic you need to talk to a doctor if you are going to do this, anyway. Please talk to a doctor if you are going keto and are diabetic! Or if you have medical issues of any kind!
* People react differently to carbs and keto. My bf was in ketosis within 24 hours. I went a month before seeing results. We ate the same damned things. Some resentment may have been had. I still struggle when passing a bakery or candy store, after a year on keto. He’s always been able to take carbs or leave them. It’s not fair, but it is as it is. And as always we have to learn to play the cards we get dealt.
* Boredom, emotional distress and just plain regular stress will make almost anyone cravy, because most of us get taught to eat our emotions aka comfort eat. Find a way to deal with this BEFORE it becomes an issue to you. The scale for handling this goes from therapy if it is REALLY bad, over sobbing on the shoulder of a good friend to hugging a teddy bear or a nice cup of tea. Remember that you are allowed to have and experience your feelings. In fact you really should. But don’t let them control your actions.
* Get your blood checked. I did it after 6 months and was so low in potassium and salt that my doctor was alarmed. Despite taking supplements. Apparently I'm a special snowflake that needs more of those things than usual. Yay me.
* The only sweeteners that doesn't affect our ketosis are Erithnol, Stevia and Monkfruit. Erithnol will give you Disaster Pants i large amounts and have a weird cooling effect in your mouth, and stevia and monkfruit both have aftertastes. Monkfruit is slightly bitter alcohol-ish to me, and stevia tastes like liquorice. Every other sweetener fucks with our ketosis. Every. (I would love to try allulose, but it is not available in Europe).
* Have you gone full carnivore/zero carb? Remember your vitamin C. Really. Scurvy is a thing, you know.

**Bonus list:**

Gastrointestinal distress? Here’s a checklist:

* Have you drunk enough water? 2-3 liters a day is commonly needed. (Dehydration clogs you up)
* Have you taken your supplements? (Magnesium and potassium helps everything along)
* Have you had enough (*any*) fiber? (Psyllium husk may help get things moving and will also STOP things moving if they are moving too much. But only if you drink enough water with it)
* Have you had any MCT oil? (If you have, stop it, it’s probably that! It is really hard on the stomach unless you are used to it)
* Have you had any sweeteners? (Was it maltitol? Bet it was. Maltitol will do that to you. **It is the devil**)

Still struggling with digestion? Try getting some ox-bile based digestive enzymes. You may not have the needed bacterial flora to handle the amounts of fat and/or meat you are eating now. Get them as a crutch and support that poor gallbladder until it has accustomed itself to your new diet. Eating lots of bitter green will also help on this point as tasting bitterness activates the gallbladder. Think rocket lettuce, endive and strong tea.

I know my TL;DR was still too long. Luckily reading this shit is voluntary.",1

Been interested in Keto for a little bit now, and especially so after I started a new workout routine and have seen major results from people doing the same routine + keto and IF. 

&#x200B;

My only issue, I work nights, usually from 5pm to 1am or 6pm to 2am. I live with a few roommates, all who are sleeping when I get home. I'm able to do my workouts and all that when I get home, I'm just not sure about cooking, or how to go about making meals. 

&#x200B;

A little more about my job/schedule - I work in security/private protection, we do a lot of foot patrols and drive all over the city, sometimes driving south or east to a whole other city. Because of this, I prefer to sleep during the day, waking up around an hour and a half before my shift starts, that way I'm refreshed and awake for my route. Believe me, I've tried doing the opposite, waking up in the morning, staying awake all day, going to work, and then sleeping right when I get home, but that's caused a lot of issues. Also, because of the heavy focus on walking, I prefer not to eat before work, and try to limit eating during work, as I tend to feel bloated and heavy after eating, even if it's something light and small. 

Because of my work/sleep schedule, I can't really do much cooking after work, as I fear waking up/disturbing my roommates. The past couple weeks I've been 'meal' prepping on my day off, but it's basically just cooking up some steak and chicken, and some veggies, like asparagus, broccoli, and a couple green peppers, and then separating and freezing it all. 

&#x200B;

Basically, I want to give Keto a shot, along with IF, doing one meal after work/after my workout, but I don't really know if it'd work with my current schedule. I know there are a ton of Keto recipes out there, would it be okay to find some that would work for me, prep/cook them on a day off, and freeze them for future meals? Or would that kill all the nutrients/possible benefits?

Any suggestions or info? Thanks!",1

Want to switch to WFPBD - where can I find a bunch of good studies on the health benefits?,2,95n09d,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/95n09d/want_to_switch_to_wfpbd_where_can_i_find_a_bunch/,15,1533770934.0,"So I've been a meat eater my whole life, fairly strong, fit and athletic, but want to switch over and try out this diet for at least 12-14 months.

Today is my second day of Keto. Prior to today I was consuming around 200g carbs per day. Yesterday I told myself screw it, it's try keto for a few weeks and see what happens. Yesterday I had less than 10g of carbs (ate some eggs, salad, and salmon and made sure to track with MFP). I felt fine. Today I made some more eggs for lunch (with bacon and some veggies). I went to the gym and lifted after lunch and came home to take a nap around 3. I woke up at 7 and for some reason I could barely move my arms and legs and I was freezing. I was also sweating like crazy while freezing, which was interesting. I'm a grown ass man (well technically a senior in college and only 21, so maybe only slightly a man) but I screamed out to my mom to come and give me a hand. I could barely sit upright and my clothes were completely drenched. There was literally no dry portion on my shirt and underwear.

After an hour or so I barely made it out to bed. I thought my blood sugar was extremely low so my mom made me some tea and honey and brought me some milk chocolate to see if that would help. It helped immensely. I'm now sitting on the toilet but honestly if it wasn't winter break and I wasn't home I felt like I could have almost died. I wasn't even able to reach my phone since I was in the middle of my king size bed.

It's now an hour later and I still slightly feel like shit. I have very bad diarrhea and I have the same feeling as when I get extremely drunk. My head is spinning around, but at least I can move a little. I'm still very cold though.

Anyway I'll update the thread later tonight or tomorrow. I just want to make people aware that this is indeed a lifestyle change. If you get similar symptoms call parents or a friend, or if it is serious enough call 911.

I'm going to try and ease my way back into Keto tomorrow, by decreasing carbs by 10g each day.",1

I have been on keto for the past year and a half or so and have lost about 50-60 pounds. It has become a lifestyle and have even gotten my parents to stay on it for quite some time. They also see the benefits, such as my dad being taken off his diabetes medicine (type 2). 

I am a geneticist that primarily works on drug development and personalized medicine for a wide range of cancers but specializes in triple-negative breast cancer and thymoma. Yesterday, a major finding was presented at arguably the largest breast cancer conference in the world (San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium - AACR). For the sake of keeping things layman, I'll try not to go into details but can answer any questions. 

The second most abundant dysregulated cellular pathway in cancer has been a pain to treat. For a number of reasons, the PI3K pathway has seen a fair share of inhibitors over the past 10 years, all with little success. Many report initial response to these inhibitors, but quickly become resistant. For this reason, many of the PI3K inhibitors are paired with chemotherapies or other drugs (one particular combination I am working on is in a Phase I in triple-negative breast cancer). Recently, it was found that insulin levels, which plays a part in this pathway, can modulate resistance to PI3K inhibitors. The scientist who originally discovered and described this pathway reported today that his lab is destroying patient derived xenografts (tumors from patients grown in mice). These tumors they are destroying are the worst of the worst (I can go into more detail if you'd like). We are talking grossly mutated pancreatic and triple-negative breast cancer tumors that do not respond to anything, even in vitro. How did he do it?

He put the mice on a keto diet and gave a standard PI3K inhibitor. That’s right. Tumors that were not responding, are now completely responding to the point where he stated he was embarrassed he hadn’t done this sooner.

This may be a lengthy post, and I have left much of the actual science out, but many oncologists have agreed that an individual with cancer would benefit from being on a strict keto diet. This is just one more link in the benefits of the keto diet.

Tldr: Keto diet decreases resistance to inhibitors targeting the second most abundant genetic pathway across all cancers.

Was Considering Keto Until I Read This Publication,6,2wf6mh,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/2wf6mh/was_considering_keto_until_i_read_this_publication/,59,1424375557.0,"I was considering trying a Ketosis diet, and I'm pretty interested in medical information, journals, etc. So I do a lot of my research that way, instead of using google or popular forums and things.

So I'm holding off until I can find some good information. It seems like Keto increases your cholesterol and does not increase weight-loss over carbohydrate rich diets.

Hope waste day is the proper expression for what I am going to ask. I started a plant based diet a couple of weeks ago and so far so good. While I appreciate the health benifits that such a diet gives, I have to admit that I miss some of the animal based products, such as cheese. I am wondering weather there is still a considerable health benefit living from plants for six days a week and have for instance on Saturday once a week a waste where everything goes.

I go back to resting my eyes, and about 15 minutes later I notice he's gotten quieter.  I happen to hear rustling, open my eyes and he's brought out the gummy worms again!  Downs 2 - 3 and bam! back to stomping, face wiping, shifting and agitated.

The goal really kept me motivated and I managed to reach 300 several weeks early, which was great, but with the goal completed I kind of lost focus and haven't really been working as hard as I should be. I've pretty much sat at the same weight of 298lbs for the last 3 weeks.

So I realized with challenge A completed, I need a new challenge to get me back on track. I realized that starting today, we have a lucky 13 weeks before Jan 1, and I've set a new goal that when I step on the scale the morning on Jan 1, the first two numbers will be 25, so 259 or better, PREFERABLY 250. I don't think this is an unrealistic goal, I have a large frame, a lot of fat to lose and it's less than 4lbs a week average.

So I figured if there was anyone here like me, maybe struggling with motivation or maybe would enjoy challenging themselves, let's do this. Whether you're just starting or have been going for some time, pick a realistic goal for the morning of Jan 1 (or the morning of Dec 31, incase you're planning on a carb-heavy New Years Eve) and lets enter 2020 on a positive note with a smashed fitness goal.

People are constantly coming on here concerned about good things. How many times have we seen the question ""I'm not hungry all the time anymore. Should I be concerned? Should I eat more?""

We're so screwed up and we've been taught for so long that eating garbage and feeling bad are normal that we can't even accept that eating right makes us feel good. And when good things happen like not needing to eat a lot our immediate reaction is to force ourselves to eat more.

We're not meant to always be hungry, cranky, tired, foggy, etc... If we were, we'd all be dead. Animals would have eaten all of us long ago.

There's a comedian named Carlos Mencia who does a joke talking about how horse meat is delicious but we don't eat it because way back some caveman saw a cow and a horse in a field and decided he was going to eat one of them. He picked up a rock and started running towards the horse and the cow. The horse saw him and ran away, the cow saw him and kept on standing in the field eating grass.

Since a young boy, I have always struggled with being overweight and have had countless failed attempts trying to lose it. On April 3rd of last year, I decided to finally commit and really push myself to the limit and beyond both physically and mentally. I knew this time was different; my mindset and determination to succeed were stronger than ever before. Over this past year, I have learned so much, about weight loss, exercise, dieting, and myself as a person. Up until now, I have been able to lose 180+ pounds thus far.

Diet:

I believe that finding a long-term sustainable diet really is essential not only for losing weight, but ensuring you keep the weight off! Finding the right plan is a person to person basis so I did a lot of experimenting with different dieting techniques including Keto until I was able to find one that I was pleased by and could see myself doing long-term. One thing I have stuck with when doing Keto or any other diet plan is OMAD/IF (One Meal A Day/Intermittent Fasting) while keeping CICO in mind which has helped me a lot with staying within my caloric deficit and feeling satisfied with how much I am eating.

Exercise:

I have been doing a bodybuilding routine in order to try to maintain and build as much muscle as possible while I am simultaneously losing all the weight I am. So doing a muscle building workout routine has definitely been key for me to help with my physique and not have me looking flat with all the weight I am losing.  Also, I workout (both lifting and cardio) in a fasted state, mainly to help burn fat and build muscle more efficiently. 

Since I started working out in April of last year, I have tried out a variety of routines (Bro Split, 4-Day UL, 6-Day UL, 6-Day PPL, 5-Day ULPPL) and have had success with all of them but find the best and most efficient for my current schedule to be the 5-Day Upper, Lower, Push, Pull, Legs routine. I do this routine while incorporating cardio (usually HIIT) right after I am done lifting on at least 3 of those days typically. For my actual workouts, compound exercises like bench press, overhead press, deadlift, pull ups, dips, squats, etc. are key and incorporated as much as possible. I also try to stay active on any rest days and get cardio in through sports like basketball, soccer, boxing, or going for a jog whenever I can.

Conclusion:

I have really grown mentally and although my weight loss journey isn’t done yet (about 40-50ish pounds to lose) I am proud of what I have accomplished thus far. Through this weight loss, not only have I been able to get myself to live a way healthier lifestyle and improve my mental and physical health, but I have also found a true purpose and calling for once in my life.

Fun fact: zero point items include skinless chicken breast and eggs.  So you could eat all the chicken and eggs and it wouldn’t count towards anything.  

Really? How is this diet healthy? Sure it monitors your calories but it’s WHAT you eat that counts not HOW MUCH you eat.  That’s what’s so great about a WFPB no oil lifestyle (not diet.) Has anyone gone from WW to plant based lifestyle? If so, are my assumptions correct? It’s disheartening to hear them talk about the guidelines :( ",0

So I've been vegan for about a week now, staying away from dairy, chicken and red meat fully, and allowing a little bit of fish. The week before that it was my birthday, so I giving myself a break from keto, eating carbs in addition to my meat. I expected a little bump in the scale, especially with it coinciding with the obnoxious bloating that comes with the time of the month for women. However, I wasn't expected a laser fast weight gain in such a short time period - in two weeks I gained about 12 lbs, despite not looking at all lumpy (I also work out 4x a week, and I look great and not flabby, but the scale don't lie). As I went keto I transitioned to a HCLF diet, the opposite of keto's LCHF model. I always feel bloated and gassy, and the extra weight has me feeling depressed and confused, especially since I'm also taking diet pill supplements that restrict my appetite and ""burn more fat"". To me, I've been eating way less, sometimes only one meal a day due to how full I feel all the time. I feel like I'm doing everything I can and my body refuses to cooperate. I fear its too late to go back on keto since I have less than 21 days to shed this weight. I don't eat nuts or vegan sweets, but I do use the gardein line for dinners. Every year I get older it becomes harder and harder to watch my weight, and I find myself wondering if I'll ever get my BMI to a normal range.

TL;DR: Weight exploded 12 lbs since I started vegan diet, despite exercise and diet pills being taken.",0
Weight goal success! 66lbs lost,1597,fdzjke,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/fdzjke/weight_goal_success_66lbs_lost/,103,1583461434.0,"[tldr: before and after](https://i.imgur.com/uScadsW.jpg)

Guys and gals I did it! I stuck to a diet and it might've been the best thing to ever happen to me. 

I feel like a million bucks, I have so much self confidence now. I make meals every day, I've gotten so much better at cooking. Clothes are fitting so much better! I feel absolutely great! 

I was 241lbs when I first started last July 2019 and decided to pure keto with zero cheat days/meals. I hit my goal yesterday of 175. 

I can't tell you all how thankful I am for this subreddit and the support I've had of family and friends. 

I could feel myself getting tired climbing stairs and doing basic chores, I had so little energy. I have a 3 yo son and I want to be active and in shape for his insane amounts of energy. I did this for him and for myself and I plan to continue this and also started a kalesthenics routine to try and add some muscle and tone. 

Thank you all! <3",1

Weight redistribution on ed recovery,2,eb3eo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/eb3eo7/weight_redistribution_on_ed_recovery/,5,1576467186.0,"Hi :)
I am currently recovering from ed and its been i guess like 3 or 4 months.
I was a pescaterian, then turned to veggie but i thought i should just become vegan so here i am.
I am mostly eating wholefood plant based but sometimes like on weekend i do eat processed vegan food.
Even thoigh i eat whole food, i eat a lot of nuts and beans  or ogher food that are high in fat and i think its because my body is still wanting to store all the fat that it can get.
I didnt completely over shoot my set point weight yet, but its visible that i did gain weight.
As i started to become vegan i think my bloating did went away a bit
And I am also on IF and i usually statt to eat around at 16 or 17 h, which is still not a good thing to do on recovery...
Idk but recently i can see that my body started to redistribute the weight, and i no longer have thin wrists
I guess thats a good thing but my friend commented how i look like ive gained weight in a good way and how i look more healthier because she knows that i am suffering from ed.
I am a bit shocked how it didnt completely affect me as ir did in the early stage of recovery but i guess i am writing it down here because it did somehow affect me.
I am just hoping for debloating as i continue this wfpb diet but idk if it would go anywhere if im eating so many nuts like i am eating right now :(
I guess all i can donis just to trust my body idk :(",0

I wasn't going to post any pictures regardless if I lost a bunch of weight or not. But seeing everyone else's progress pictures really inspired me!

My starting weight was 375
I'm 24 years old(M).
I am at 265 going to the gym at least 3-4 times a week. 

I've tried a lot of things. But depression and eating went hand and hand. Idk what happened I really think I hit my rock bottom. I didn't want to socialize with anyone. Or do anything but eat. I guess I finally realized that this is it. This is my life. It's just gonna waste away and be worthless because I would rather day dream about dieting and losing weight instead of actually doing it. 

I still struggle with depression. But it's getting better very slowly. And I truly believe it will get better. I don't wanna give up anymore. I wanna go out and meet people now before it's too late and I waste this weird lucky life I have.  Idk if anyone would take the time to read this. If you do thank you so very much. I'm just finally proud of myself. It's a weird ass feeling lol. But I do. And I don't feel shameful about it as well. 

This most definitely isn't the end of my weightloss journey. I will not give up. And if you feel like ""there is no way I could ever do it"" that's compete bullshit. You've got this. YOU KNOW WHY?! BECAUSE SOME STRANGER WHO LOST SOME WEIGHT ON REDDIT SAID SO! 

So good luck out there who are on, starting or finishing up their journey. It's tough out there. But it's a lot tougher if you are overweight af. 

Love you keto peeps. You all inspire me and motivate me ever time I log into Reddit.

edit: A number of people have pointed out that I am not cured.  This is correct, so let's be clear:  diabetes is a disease of insulin resistance.  I may have my blood sugar under control but that does not mean I have fixed my insulin resistance issues.  It is under control by limiting carbs.  Measuring insulin resistance over time requires an insulin assay, which is not a test I have had.  

I suppose I am lucky because eating keto has come easy for me and is a permanent lifestyle change.  If you decide to try keto to get your t2 diabetes under control, go into it knowing that it will likely be a diet change for the rest of your life unless you want to descend back into t2 diabetes.  

Below is an excellent interview Ivor Cummins did with Dr. Kraft, a true pioneer in diabetes testing  (Ivor is a real hero of mine too).  This interview was the first personal research I did when I first got my diagnosis, and boy did it send me down the rabbit hole.

What (almost) 4 years of ketogenic dieting did to me.,2031,6aqf03,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/6aqf03/what_almost_4_years_of_ketogenic_dieting_did_to_me/,306,1494612464.0,"(almost) old timer here looking to give the newbies some hope. Here is my story.

I'm 35/M, 6ft. tall & coming up on 4 years of consistent ketogenic dieting. 
Started out at 270lbs. Currently 168lbs.

Here is how the plot developed for me:

-- Year 0 --

After deciding that my type 2 diabetes symptoms, cardiac issues, joint issues, general poor health, and having tried nearly every other diet to no avail wasn't working for me, I decided to take the plunge and try keto despite all the warnings that it would kill me. I set a goal for 200lbs.

Started tracking calories and running a 10-20% deficit and stuck religiously to 20g/carbs a day. The first month was very hard but i just kept doing it anyway. Immediately dropped 20lbs in the first month. Then 15, then 10, and by the end of the year, slowed down to about 5lbs/mo.

Chest pains and palpitations began to subside. Type 2 diabetes symptoms completely vanished. Knee pain went from a 9 to a 6. Brain fog went away, making me a more effective computer programmer. Lots of wins.

And in general, I started feeling good about my future, knowing that there was a way to control my weight. Finally being handed the control knobs to my metabolism was a huge win.

The only negative was a random sharp pain under my ribcage that couldn't be explained by the keto community or medical professionals. The lower carb i went, the more it seemed to hurt. Still, i was not dismayed and KCKO'd.

-- Year 1 --

Hit my 200lbs goal and got greedy and aimed for 180. My heart function became so good that the chest pains that haunted me since 18 were completely gone. ED went away and i started having good endurance in the sack. Started taking walks and biking again. 

Then, i took it a bit further and started physical therapy for my knees. The therapist had me doing exercises in the pool with people who were 60-90 years old, but i could barely manage to keep up - that's how bad i was. It was so painful and difficult that i broke into tears multiple times in front of everyone... but knee function improved significantly. I was at least able to walk a mile.

Once i could consistently walk and not live in terror of a heart attack, my confidence in myself really soared and my outlook on life changed. I started thinking about investing in myself long term, instead of just getting by. This was the biggest change. This lead me to tackle some debt in year 2 and start saving for retirement, because i felt like i was actually gonna survive my 30's.

Compliments on my weight loss started rolling in, along with the usual questions of how i did it. I got preachy about keto and made a few converts.

But i wasn't really happy with my body yet. I still had some chub and i was out of shape. Loose skin everywhere too; but it was still an improvement.

-- Year 2 --

At 180lbs here.

Physical therapy got me into the gym and i started going semi regularly and saw more gains in knee function and a little bit of visible muscle. I was extremely weak and started out pushing a mere 20-30lbs on most machines, which was extremely embarrassing around other men. But i figured everyone is a n00b once and just kept grinding for EXP.

I began to get hooked to going to the gym. It gave me a boost in dude hormones and mental clarity and energy. I decided it was well worth the time.

I got lazy with keto and went from 180lbs to 200lbs that year. Some of that weight was muscle but i had added some chub. I was dismayed by this backslide.

I started working a physical job instead of a desk job and found that i could finally tolerate it, with some pain. My knees were healing, and being lighter lowered the load on them, and the pain level was down to a 5 or 4.

Mysterious under ribcage pain left me this year, too.

-- Year 3 --

I was having trouble getting the extra weight off and decided to try intermittent fasting with calorie restriction. 30lbs vanished as fast as it did when i started keto and i was amazed. At 170lbs, the muscle i'd put on had started to show. I started to look fit. The saggy skin began to fade in appearance.

I stopped intermittent fasting at 170lbs because i did not want to look like a rail. Went back to lazy keto. 

Went from pushing 20-30lbs last year around to 90-120lbs. It was a very slow grind, because i had to work around popping and snapping joints. I took it slow and easy, and my joints improved. But I am no longer self conscious at the gym because i am pushing what average guys push, by now.

My joints and physical function had improved so much that i kept working a physical job. I biked and walked even more, even immediately after torturing my arms and legs at the gym. Knee pain is down to a 3 or 4, and days that i need to take anti inflammatories are very rare.

I began to start liking my body this year, and obviously some other people do too, because random women started flirting with me. I still have an ugly belly and some loose skin, but you can't tell until i take my shirt off and the rest of me looks pretty good in contrast, so i'm not self conscious about that anymore. I can do surgery later if i like.

I am 168lbs today, and feel 10 years younger. I feel like i've been given a new life by keto. Weight loss was just the beginning of all of this.

And that being said, i'd like to thank this entire community for your posts, especially early on. I wouldn't have been able to do it without you guys. I am also amazed by the size of this sub; it only had ~20,000 subscribers when i started. It is amazing how many people you folks have helped save.

OK ok so it's not exactly 20 lbs it's 19.4 lbs (almost 9 kg). I was not planning to post a progress Pic until I hit my goal but seeing others do have been very motivational for me so I just wanted to show what can be achieved in a little over a month on keto and encourage those who are hesitant to start. This is 5 weeks of progress. 

I feel so great physically, I used to feel pain in my ribs when I cough and felt like I'm gonna explode. Now I'm breathing better and no more back pain. I'm 5'9"" if anyone is wondering.

#Edit: adding some notes below that repeat in the comments/private messages

- I lost 17 lbs the first 3 weeks through diet alone then started the insanity program (HIIT workouts) in week 4. Excerxice+diet lost me only 3 lbs in two weeks but I see and feel significantly different with exercice.

- I was on 30% deficit before I started excerxice and I went as low as 40% on days where I didn't feel hungry/if I could. I'm not sure how much I'm losing with insanity but I started eating for 20% deficit and my guess is what I burn puts me around 40% deficit (assuming I'm burning 400-500 calories/workout). This should keep me on track to lose 2 lbs or around 1kg per week. 

- I eat only when I'm hungry, and have my dinners around 7pm so I'm in at least 12 hour fasted state before breakfast. Even though I set 30-40% deficit, on days where I don't feel hungry I go as low as 50%. 

- I've always gained/lost weight in my core only so the difference is more obvious in pics since the weight loss is localized. Also I was always bloated after eating carbs, and though I never tested I think I am gluten intolerant based on how I felt. 

- My goal is to lose total of 31 kgs (68 lbs) before my 31st birthday and this challenge I set is keeping me motivated and on track so far. So this is not the end goal I still have 48 lbs to go.

"What 4 Months of Keto Looks Like on a 5'1"" Woman",1600,95erpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/95erpz/what_4_months_of_keto_looks_like_on_a_51_woman/,148,1533699018.0,"I know you guys want [photos](https://www.instagram.com/p/BmMDf4UAhAO/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=jgmtosi60vve) first...

I started Keto late January and I've lost 40 pounds so far (10 shy of my goal), but I came across this shirt while I was purging my closet and remembered I had taken a photo in it when I first bought it 4 months ago and couldn't help take a comparison photo.  

Feel free to ask me anything about my 203 days so far.  I will say the following basics are what kept me in check:

* Log your food Every. Single. Day.  When you're bad, when you're good... Just get in the habit. And never give up.  Miss a day?  Try to recall and add it in anyway.  Hold yourself accountable.  Especially when eating out.

* Recalculate your macros after weight loss... The recommendation is every 10 pounds but for a shorty like me every calorie counts so I did it every 5 pounds.

* Take your measurements every couple of weeks.  You will have weeks where you lose nothing. Ladies, we have at least one week we lose per month (at least I do) where the scale doesn't shift or worse, goes up.  Take. Your. Measurements.  Your body will stop the loss and take it's time to reshape itself. I'm convinced of this.  So seeing the inches reduce is major!

* Cook as many meals as humanly possible.  I calculated that I cooked about 93% of all my meals in those 4 months. I was in complete control if what I was putting in my body.

* Surround yourself with people who will support your new lifestyle.  I'm very fortunate to have friends who quickly learned to not push food on me and are willing to pick activities or restaurants that are accommodating.

* Listen to your body.  If you're not hungry, don't eat.  If you're ravenous, make smart choices.  I'll stuff my face with a packet of prosciutto or turkey breast or a cup of raw broccoli and some sort of delicious dip, drink a massive glass of water, and then wait 20 minutes to see if I'm actually ravenous.  If I'm still hungry then I'll give myself some sort of treat - keto bark or almonds or ricotta mixed with cocoa powder and erythritol or an enlightened ice cream bar.  But usually the water and small snack do the trick.

* Nope - I didn't exercise at all.  I did a handful of long walks, went on a hike a couple times, and went kayaking one day.  But no gym for me ever.  This loss was all dietary.

* Be kind to yourself and trust the process.  It works.  You didn't put on the weight in a single night or even a single year.  Give yourself a break and time to heal.

Now calm down, and continue eating your avacado, this is not a hate parade on keto, I'm simply here to help you bro.

I really wanted to be sub 10% bodyfat, I was religious about my diet, worked out  4-5 times a week, yet seemed to get little to no results. I was stuck in that place for 1 year, and for 95% it I was doing straight keto. I clinged on to keto because so much of the science and information out there seemed so convincing, in favor of going low carb. In addition I actually quite enjoyed eating keto foods, and I liked the simplicity of monitoring my carbs. But there's just no way around the fact, that it gave me piss poor results.

The last 2 months I've switched to something close to a 40/40/20 split, and I look better than I've ever looked. Leaning out like crazy, while building muscle and having better energy. Total calories identical. I mostly stick to the classic bro foods like chicken, brown rice, veggies and eggs. It just fucking works.

Now, I still think keto can be a useful tool, and it might be better for some people(especielly if you're overweight). But if you're already fairly lean (10-16% bodyfat) and struggling to get results on keto, please do yourself a favor and try a different approach. Don't keep doing it just because  you have convinced yourself it is the only right way to do it.

Now again, I'm not hating on keto, I think it's a perfectly healthy way to eat, but in terms of body composition it didn't work for me at all, and this is coming from someone who preached low carb all the time.

In the end, experiment and try different things. What works best for YOUR body, might be something else than you thought. Alot of the science out there is contradictory or incomplete, I think we sometimes have to trust anecdotal evidence.

Good luck.

I'm not really that worried about that part. I figure the weight loss will come with time. I'm mostly worried if I'm even in ketosis. I have a breath ketone meter that consistently registers 2.0 or higher. But my urine ketostix have NEVER registered me as being in ketosis unless I've been fasting for about 24 hours.

I've been doing Intermittent Fasting and Alternate Day Fasting for about a year. I'm still fasting at LEAST 16 hours per day, but usually closer to 20 hours fast per day.

This can include dietary habits that go a little beyond wfpb guidelines (eg: smoothie every morning, eating the daily dozen every day, tracking calories), but also more general lifestyle things. 

For me, it’s the following:

- Exercising regularly (I run or walk at least 5 miles a day, plus have a bodyweight HIIT routine I do about 2-3 times/week) My morning workouts tend to set me up to feel accomplished and productive, and walking in the afternoon helps me manage anxiety. 

- I only drink coffee once a week. As a student, I like knowing that coffee is there for me when I have a lot to accomplish. I don’t see a reason to cut it out completely, but I know that it will be more effective having it less often. 

- Talking to myself like a coach. Positive self-talk is something everyone struggles with, and this really helped me out.

I feel that both of these are very helpful on their own right. The date sugar helps you get in some extra fruit instead of just pure sugar. If we go off calorie count, 1 serving is approximately 1 date (~20 calories). As for the pumpkin, I feel like it's really helpful because it's so easy to use.

start date 9/12/20 -- PCOS & IR -- not T2D

I'm sorry if I have asked this before, but didn't see much info in the FAQs about eating anything higher that a 20% caloric deficit. I used the [ankerl](https://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/) keto calculator. It suggests I eat around ~2000 calories daily. I started on an appetite suppressant medication (Vyvanse) to treat my ADD and BED a week after restarting keto, so my appetite is pretty minimal. The med is supposed to help me lose weight and it's shown in multiple trials and user reviews that it does that.

Since week 2 of keto, I'm struggling to reach 1400 calories (which is closer to a 45% caloric deficit). I am eating real, whole foods, getting my low carb veggies daily, I don't eat nuts, soy, or crappy vegetable oils (mostly just avocado, EVOO, and coconut), don't drink alcohol, cut out the sweeteners (including erythritol and Allulose -- but I still have a few drops of organic liquid monk fruit in my coffee), cut back on dairy, and tracking/weighing everything that crosses my lips in Carb Manager. I get very close or meet my protein goal daily. Drink lots of water with added electrolytes but I can't stomach more than 100oz daily or it makes me feel sick. I do a 20:4 or 18:6 IF window daily to help prevent loose skin. I don't get much exercise bc I'm partly disabled, so I'm trying to lose weight mostly with diet. I weigh myself once a week on Saturday mornings after a BM. I feel like I am doing keto ""textbook"" and not seeing the results I NEED to save my health and please my doctors. My PCP and dietician are PISSED. They see someone who is over 350 lbs that has only lost 13 pounds in 5 weeks as a cheater and a liar. I even showed them my food diary to show I've barely been eating 1400-1500 calories per day. My dietitian doubled my dose of Vyvanse to further cut my appetite then I got chewed out for cheating on my diet when I haven't -- until last night. Getting chewed out triggered a carb binge episode (Chinese food) but no change in the scale this morning. I feel like I'm about to give up already.

The first time I did keto (from Jan 2017 to August 2017), I wasn't exactly doing it very healthy because by month 5, I would barely eat 900 calories daily bc I struggled to feel hungry. I convinced myself it was ""fine"" bc I was still over 300 pounds. I was losing 10 pounds consistently every month, feeling FANTASTIC, but by month 8, my hair started falling out in clumps in the shower. While it healed my insulin resistance and prediabetes, I realized I was developing an eating disorder and stopped doing keto. Since then, I've developed Binge Eating Disorder (more from trauma in 2018) and have regained the 100 pounds I lost + 20 pounds by eating 3000 to 5000 calories per day. This year alone, I think that I have gained 50 pounds, but can't say for sure since I was avoiding the scale.

Guess I'm not sure what to do to please my doctors and myself to see better results. Should I try cutting my calories even further to 1200 calories? I watch that *My 600 lb Life* show and Dr. Now puts all his bariatric patients on a 1200 calorie, high protein diet and they seem ok. I am worried about the long-term effects though.",1

She pipes up, ""I am talking about you.  I am not trying to be rude but you have lost so much weight and look so much healthier, I was bragging on your progress."".  Several of the people then asked how much I had lost, when I said 50lbs several gasped.   This was wild but meeting time happened and I filed it away in the back of my head.   
A week and a half ago I went out for drinks.   An acquaintance whom I have several mutual friends with actually came across the bar (it was packed). Plopped down in front of me and said, ""How did you do it?"".   I looked bewildered, I am sure.  She pointed at my waist and said ""That!   You look amazing."".   I beamed and explained all about Keto.   I may have very explained as I had had a few drinks.   She was enthusiastic.
Last week one of the co-workers from the first group caught me in the hall on our way out for the day and told me she had told her mom all about my weight loss and recommend keto to her.   This made me happy.

I'm underweight, I need to be eating more food in general and I'd rather that food be from plant sources. I read about nutrition and I know I'm eating a disproportionate amount of protein and saturated fats, I'd rather not increase that. I want to eat more healthy fats and carbs. I don't care about ""bulking up"" or gaining more muscle. For now I just need to get to a healthy weight.

I'm the kind of person that does too much research and tires myself out, which is why this time I'm asking here instead of googling it and going down the nutrition rabbit hole for days and coming out too overwhelmed to make any real changes.

I'm a 20 year old male 220lbs, not super muscular by any means. I've been refining the way I think about food over the last couple years from being totally obsessed with thinking about what I was gonna be eating in a day and eating whatever junk I wanted to choosing to eat more veggies and not buying junk food really at all. I've made so much progress on this front of just thinking about food better and I want to keep it going. 

This previous semester I started the semester at 230lbs and finished it at 220lbs. I barely touched exercise at all because I neglected making an effort to go to the gym but I knew I could lose weight by just focusing on nutrition because I study nutrition at uni and I learn about metabolic processes and how to eat properly and what foods are good for different nutrients. 

For a short time (3weeks) I did the plant-paradox diet w/ my roommate but found that it wasn't really for me. From there I did the diet about halfway because I liked the food that I could have on that diet but I was still really missing grains from my life. I decided to just totally ditch that diet entirely and focus on making meals from simple ingredients that would be filling and nutritious. Typically eggs with a bit of cheese and hot sauce on an English muffin for breakfast with a fruit and veggies for lunch, sometimes shwarma from a deli on campus, and some sort of meat with cooked veggies for dinner. 

Basically where I'm at now is that a plant-based diet is really intriguing to me because of the health benefits but I'm confused on what exactly the normal view of a whole-food plant based diet is. Ive learned in school that poly/mono unsaturated fats are good in moderation because of what they promote and inhibit in the body

So here are my basic questions:
What's the deal with olive oil, do y'all have it in small amounts, a lot of it, or avoid it entirely? Mostly asking because I've seen that olives are good, so why not the oil that from from them.
Also, what's the deal with granulated sugar, brown sugar, maple syrup, do y'all avoid it, embrace it, or small amounts? 
Lastly, I'm worried about eggs because they're in so many dishes and I looove eggs. For you egg lovers, how do you handle this? 

Please don't just link me to other studies or other posts, I'm just looking to hear what you guys do about these foods and what the general view of them is. 

Tldr: im intrigued by doing a plant-based diet, but I see varying opposing views of what is acceptable",0

What is the point?,0,9860uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9860uk/what_is_the_point/,19,1534568782.0,"So I’ve been doing keto for about two weeks now and I had some initial success. But I’ve been thinking... if I eat more calories in whatever form (fat, carbs, protein) my body will store it as fat. Therefore, regardless of the diet, I have to be running a caloric deficit each day.

But if that is the case, then what happens if I have say 100g of carbs each day but still running a caloric deficit each day. Even though I won’t be in ketosis, won’t my body start burning stored fat because 100g of carbs isn’t enough?

So my question is, what exactly is being in this ketosis mode doing better than not being in it but say 50g carbs over?

Edit: Thanks everyone! This has definitely cleared some things up in my mind. I won’t feel guilty now if I have something that will push me over the carb limit. I will just have to keep in mind it might make me hungry in a short while (I was at a birthday party yesterday and didn’t have the cake which was made out of donut bread... total drool.)

The sugar and insulin issue is another thing I didn’t think about. There has to be something said for the healthfulness of limiting sugar intake.

Thanks for the insight!",1

Went from ~160 to my current weight 122 over two years, and lost the last 15 on Keto/CICO within the last 6 months:

http://imgur.com/gallery/WSdyN4X


For my fellow short people: you CAN do this. You will lose weight very slowly, but stay strong and do not quit! Quitting is the only sure way that you will never reach your goal weight. 


There were days (too many) that I ate over 2000 kcal, sometimes weeks where my average intake was 1600 kcal. There were sedentary weeks and days. But I logged EVERYTHING, and after each fuckup I always went back to CICO, monitoring macros, and exercising. The fuckups made me lose weight more slowly, but persistence is what helped me get here at all. 


In the last 4 weeks I've been maintaining my weight, lifting weights (PPL) and doing HIIT by going to the gym 6 days per week. In terms of exercise, I've found that routine is your friend. If you always schedule gym in a certain time slot, then it's much harder to skip it, going to the gym just becomes part of your day-to-day.


Now this might be a bit controversial for this sub - and let me start by saying it's 100% possible to lift on keto, and maintain on keto indefinitely - HOWEVER, I found myself constantly hungry and low in energy while lifting with little carbs (where keto never left me feeling very hungry before). So, in the last 3 weeks I've been adding them back to my diet to help with my energy levels/insane hunger while working out. 


I started the first few weeks slowly with upping from 20g to 50g, with 50% carbs consumed before going to the gym. This caused me to gain ~3 lbs back, but found that I felt more energetic and less hungry, which improved my motivation to the gym and work hard.


Now I'm back down to my low weight of 122, and I'm upping to ~100g carbs and 1g protein/weight of muscle mass while doing CICO.


The point of this is - listen to your body, and do what works for you. If you need to incorporate carbs back in, do it slowly and be prepared to regain some initial water weight. Keto is a great and effective way to lose weight, and I'll forever be grateful for trying it, but don't be afraid to adjust your macros if it stops working for you or your lifestyle. 

Be flexible, be persistent, be honest with yourself about what you consume, and you'll get there eventually!",1

Before the flight, I had four eggs with cheese and bacon for breakfast. Didn't have lunch because the meals on the flight weren't compatible. Had dinner at a restaurant at Caesars around 7pm, double cheeseburger with no bun, large salad with blue cheese.

Woke up at 4:30am today to get a run in on the Strip before my speech. Ran three miles, faster than I have in a while. (9:38 pace.) The conference had breakfast but it was 99% carbs. They did have breakfast burritos of eggs and sausage, so I unrolled two and ate the insides without the wrap. Drank my usual ton and a half of water.

Did a one-hour keynote from 8:30-9:30am in front of 1,800 people. Back to LAS Airport at 12:30pm, had a several handfuls of Mozzarella cheese in the United lounge (all they had that was compatible) and am now on the plane.

Again, no plane dinner worked for me, and knowing the odds, I bought some beef jerky before boarding, but here's the kicker:

I HAD ZERO PROBLEM SAYING NO TO THE FREE DINNER ON BOTH FLIGHTS. I didn't even hesitate. Anytime in the past I'd ever gotten serious about my diet, my discipline would always fade in these situations, and next thing I knew I'd have had my dinner, the desert, and the damn airplane cookie, then when I got home, I'd go to town on whatever I had. I was always STARVING, and would always give in.

On Keto, I'm simply NOT STARVING. In fact, I sometimes need to be reminded to eat!! It's just AMAZING to me what happens when you power your body with something other than empty processed carbs.

I freaking love this lifestyle. Thanks for letting me rant from the sky somewhere over the US.",1

Today inkilled some Baby back ribs, cucumber salad and Greek salad.  To die for man.....

So the people in front of me had chocolate as well, a few bars of 75% and 85% stuff.  The cashier , I'm guessing trying to make conversation,  mentions how that chocolate is tough to eat and too strong and all this negative jazz. The people in front just smiled and said that they like their chocolate strong blah blah .

What You must understand at this point is that My issue was not with his answer, it was the face he made. Same face every single skeptic makes when you try to explain keto.

Yes, you eat fat, yes you loose weight, yes you feel great.  But that face remained....


Oh, but not only did the face remain,  he decides to lecture me on ketosis. He explained  that it mean your body is starving and that's why it eats its own body fat. He explained that this is dangerous and bad for you and so on and that he would never get on it blah blah

Wait , did I mention he was fat,  cause let me tell you with a absolutely no intentions of being a dick that If someone needed it .....well he needed it. Just like I needed when I took the plunged into this amazing diet.


So I tried to explain to how this works, how it's not dangerous, and how its helped me. but I can see it in his face, he's not buying what I'm selling. He's clinging to his argument as what I could only explain as an excuse for him not to engage. I felt a little sad after that exchange. I fel like I failed that dude because I had the key but couldn't give them to him.

"" dude , this diet is great, why dont you try it ?""

"" because i don't wanna die. ""


So I ask you, what the fuck is with skeptics ?????!!!!

What's your daily meal plan like?,6,j91fny,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/j91fny/whats_your_daily_meal_plan_like/,28,1602431849.0,"It's my second time doing keto. Lost 25lbs and kept it off ever since, but need to lose more to be at a healthy weight.

It's day 10 and I lost 3lbs, but I'm already feeling mentally deprived. Like I have all this tasty food in my fridge, but I do not want to eat it.

Meal Plan:

Hamburger with keto bun: cheese slice with no carbs, lettuce, homemade thousand island dressing with a hamburger patty.

Turkey sandwich with keto bread: turkey slices, lettuce, mayo, mustard, keto bread and a slice of cheese.

Bacon with one of the two meals above.

Mexican salad: guac, shredded cheese, sour cream, a little bit of salsa, some spring mixed greens or a handful of spinach.

I drink coffee with monkfruit sugar and heavy cream. Sometimes I have coffee with premier protein caramel shake.

Any suggestions to  get over this mental block, meal recipes, or just want to say something (please be nice and respectful)

P.S. I know some might say just get over it food is just fuel, but it can also be an experience where people enjoy consuming food for taste as well as presentation etc.",1

1 tbs maple syrup


2 teaspoons dried crushed dill OR a bunch of fresh dill, minced.

Whole Food Plant Based Diet has too much Manganese and Chia seeds have trans fats?,0,7ffcfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/7ffcfg/whole_food_plant_based_diet_has_too_much/,14,1511647163.0,"I think it's virtually impossible to eat a WFPBD without a Manganese intake way above upper limit of 11 mg a day especially if you are highly active and need a lot of calories. Oats for example has 4.9 mg per 100 g, Lentils 1.393 mg per 100 grams. 

>There is a concern that manganese intakes in vegan diets can be high. To date, manganese toxicity in vegans has not been studied, but manganese toxicity usually does not occur with amounts of manganese found in the diet. However, iron deficiency can cause an increase in manganese absorption and vegans with iron deficiency should make sure they eat vitamin C at meals so that iron is absorbed instead of manganese.

http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/manganese

>Rich sources of manganese include whole grains, nuts, leafy vegetables, and teas. Foods high in phytic acid, such as beans, seeds, nuts, whole grains, and soy products, or foods high in oxalic acid, such as cabbage, spinach, and sweet potatoes, may slightly inhibit manganese absorption. 

http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/minerals/manganese#food-sources

Chia seeds have 0.140 g trans fats per 100 g. Flax seeds might be problematic for other reasons.
[link](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/3610?fgcd=&manu=&lfacet=&format=&count=&max=50&offset=&sort=default&order=asc&qlookup=Chia+seeds&ds=&qt=&qp=&qa=&qn=&q=&ing=)

This means that this diet is not perfect, like any other diets, but we have to take the risks for the benefits, chia seeds have an enormous amount of omega-3 and virtually zero omega-6, the ratio between those two can be very important. Hence it's probably a good idea to have 1-2 tablespoons a day, and take the minuscule amount of trans-fats.

With regards to manganese, it seems like a good idea to keep it below 11 mg but above the DRI of 1.8 mg a day for women and 2.3 for men. However, if it turns impractical, it is probably worthwhile to read the Linus Pauling Institute article and vegan RD article. Then decide whether to stop WFPBD, continue but accept high manganese intakes, or deal with the impracticality of picking one's foods carefully (like no oats). I have checked myself, and it's definitely possible to keep it below 11 MG if you have a low caloric need and stay away from oats. But if you are an athlete and you need maybe 1000 calories more than the average Joe, it definitely seems to get harder without something like white potato or sweet potato depending where you live.

Let me know what you think, if you have come across this info as well, and I am especially interested in what foods you've eaten to keep manganese intakes at bay.

Whole Foods Plant Based 'pancakes'+icecream+chocolate syrup,2,en46k2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/en46k2/whole_foods_plant_based_pancakesicecreamchocolate/,1,1578754349.0,"Got an idea for something mixing some of the usual favourites. The pancakes are chapati or Indian crepe things. Just take water and chickpea flour in equal volumes and mix. Then pour a bit on hot pan and cook them a bit like crepes or pancakes but try to keep them thin.  
Ice cream is basic nicecream. Take peeled frozen bananas and frozen mango chunks. Carefully put them through nicecream machine. My juicer doubles as a nicecream machine it is great :) .  


Chocolate syrup came our surprisingly good. Half a cup of raw fair trade cacao powder, several pitted dates, several figs, enough water to make it work. Blend in a food processor. Comes out so sweet and chocolatey - I think this beats most cake icing I've tried in my life. You may want to reduce the number of dates but this was meant to be served to people who like regular packaged foods.

Pile it all on top of each other and voila :) . The chocolate mess was left over. The crepes can be made in all kinds of ways adding spice mixes, adding some corn meal, or even bits of gourd in there.

This satisfied some serious cravings leaving the tummy feeling full but light :)

Wholefood Plant Based Keto Cycling from Living with Perpetually empty glycogen stores by end of day?,0,jc56yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/jc56yi/wholefood_plant_based_keto_cycling_from_living/,6,1602860488.0,"Hi Community,

Apologies up front if this theme automatically puts me in the bad graces of the keto community; but my situation is: I'm plant based whole foods and want to know if I'm usually in full ketosis (not just empty liver ketosis) for much of each day, even though I eat lots of whole foods, including legumes, nuts, some whole grains; based on, and here's the kicker, I frequently do four day fasts and am comfortable having near on zero glycogen in my system (i.e. muscle or liver) when I start each day.

I'm also doing TRE (Time Restricted Eating) and limiting my meal time to somewhere in the order of 9 hours a day (i.e. approx 15 hour fast) per day.

I -think- that I should be enjoying full ketosis for at least a good solid chunk of each day, since I'm confident I should be starting each day with zero glycogen (in muscles or liver). When I have my first meal around 8AM, I allow carbs in, but since I only consume my BMR per day (maybe even a bit less), then I should be ending the day a few hours after my last meal with zero carbs in my muscles or liver, meaning the ketosis should be well underway a few hours later, to the point that I'd be fully ketogenic the next morning.

Is this how ketosis works? Can you keto-cycle like this in the full blown way as opposed to just the empty liver way on a daily basis? And get some significant portion those keto goodies in me for at least a part of each day? In terms of keto adaption, I've recently gone about 14 days with no food, so think that surely my body is pretty adept at using ketones by now, even though I don't have a ketogenic diet.

Thank you all very much for any info you can provide on this. I've researched Dom D'agostino and Rhonda Patrick fairly extensively but haven't been able to find anything about this.",1

Why I cried in the Target dressing room ...,2605,aqwzy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/aqwzy7/why_i_cried_in_the_target_dressing_room/,187,1550269197.0,"I’ve been doing Keto since November 5th, 2018. Started at 351lbs and as of this morning, I am 296lbs. My usual size 24w jeans were starting to feel looser than normal (I’ve kept wearing them all this time) so I went to Target last night to find something cheap for the time being. I don’t want to splurge on any clothing until I’m closer to my goal weight.

So I grabbed a pair of $20 jeans, size 22w this time and to my surprise they were way too big also! YOU GUYS. I had to keep going back out into the store to get smaller sizes until I put on a MOTHER EFFING SIZE 16w. I’m 23 years old, and I’m officially the size I was in eighth grade. Still a long ways off from where I would like to be, but this felt like a victory!! 



Edit: I didn’t realize anyone would really overanalyze the hell out of this post, but to address a couple “concerns.” I’m 5’6. The jeans are a size 16 in the Target women’s section and probably have a good amount of stretch. I have long legs, am pretty top heavy, and have been combining my Keto efforts with cardio like boxing and jogging 3ish days a week. Not everybody’s body is evenly proportionate. Not everyone loses weight in all the same places at all the same time. My legs and face are definitely the areas I’ve noticed the most slimming. I probably would still pick up a size 22/24 shirt despite being 16/18 in pants. I also feel bummed that people’s suspicious comments got to me, and made me feel insecure about my shape. THANKS LOL. Most everyone else has been amazing tho. THANK YOU FOR REAL ❤️❤️❤️",1
Why I regret doing Keto...,2413,d0zcrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/d0zcrz/why_i_regret_doing_keto/,278,1567908307.0,"I know that being the Keto Subreddit, the diet gets lots of love around here. But let me tell you some of the reasons that I regret having started Keto.

First, it's expensive. Since April, I've dropped two sizes in both my pants and my shirts. Do you know ridiculous it looks for a 34 waist to wear 38 waist pants? And the shirts look even worse on me. 5 months ago I wore an XL, and now, I have to wear a medium. A MEDIUM!! I don't even know where that section in the store is. I've had to buy a whole new wardrobe, and now my kids are starving.

Second, I'm always cold. I'm 'that guy' in the office complaining that they should turn the air down when its 85 degrees outside. I always have to leave a light sweater hanging on my chair so that I can put it on during the day. My fingers feel like they're frozen--which has greatly affected my productivity (it's really hard to type when you can't feel your fingers). It's super frustrating.

Third, I'm always uncomfortable now. That kitchen set that I bought 6 months ago, with solid cherry wood chairs?? Useless. Now that I've lost a bunch of fat from my backside, it feels like I'm sitting right on my bones. It hurts. I need to adjust every few seconds. It's even uncomfortable sitting in the seat of my car. I did not sign up for this.

Finally, people wont stop bothering me. It's actually pretty annoying. I was relatively unknown before, but now people are making all these comments like ""wow you look so great"" or ""what is your secret?"" or ""can you help me lose weight too?"" I can't just roll out of bed and stroll into work looking like a mess anymore. I need to take some time in the morning to look presentable, because who knows who might stop to talk to me. So I have to wake up like 30 minutes earlier.... it's killing me.

In all honesty, Keto has changed my life. For anyone who is contemplating Keto (or anyone who just started), I want you to know a few things:

&#x200B;

* I was the guy who tried everything. Nothing worked for me, until Keto.
* It does get easier. I promise.
* People *will* tell you it's not good for you. Don't listen. If you are fat, I GUARANTEE eating Keto is better than how you're eating now.
* If you have a spouse/significant other who also needs to lose weight, you have to get them on board. Sorry, but it's really challenging to have to cook separate meals for everyone, and it's really tempting to have those non-keto foods that your husband/wife refuses to give up.
* Tracking Macros is important, but at first, I really recommend just focusing on carbs. 20-25 max. Don't guess. If you don't know, don't eat it. Track everything in MyFitnessPal and make sure to subtract the fiber and (good) sugar alcohols.
* Speaking of sugar alcohols, do some research. Find out whats ok (stevia, monkfruit, erythritol) and what's not (sugar, maltodextrin/malitol, coconut sugar).
* Finally, if you've failed to lose weight time and time again, set a short term goal. That's how I did it. I committed to 30 days, and no more. If I wasn't happy with the progress in a month, I told myself I'd quit. I figured, after 20+ years of eating whatever I wanted, I could surely sacrifice 30 days to give Keto a shot. Five months later, and I'm still going strong. You will see progress in 30 days, and it will motivate you to keep going. 

SW: 253lbs (January 2019)

My point the crux of it is the high fat low carb is not palatable for the vast majority of people and is seen as just ‘another diet’. 

For most people who I have met, the repetitive tastes of cream, cheese and egg soon becomes very tedious. I know there’s ways to change it but personally I don’t see how people last more than 6 months.

Why am I still hungry after this WFPB breakfast?,4,dl3l86,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/dl3l86/why_am_i_still_hungry_after_this_wfpb_breakfast/,32,1571706543.0,"Hi all, 

I made myself some WFPB apple cinnamon oats with a banana this morning. Altogether, the breakfast was about 569 calories, according to Cronometer, with 15 grams of protein and 17 grams of fat. So why was I so uncomfortably hungry until lunch? 

The bowl had: 

\- 1 serving Quaker old fashioned oats (about a half cup cooked)

\- About half an apple stewed with chopped dates and a tiiiny bit of maple syrup, to make a sort of ""apple pie"" filling

\- A small handful of chopped pecans 

\- Soy milk

And I had a banana on the side. I purposely ate it separately in hopes it would leave me feeling fuller, rather than cooking it into the oats.

To give some background, I'm a 5'3 female, 142 lbs, looking to lose 10-15 lbs after gaining that weight over the past few years. I've been vegan since June and vegetarian for almost 2 years, but for the past 2 months or so I ate horribly (lots of takeout and processed food - yay, depression!). 

So I guess what I'm asking is: Why did this breakfast not leave me feeling satisfied? How can I make it a bit more filling, ideally without adding any more calories? I used to be so good at portion control, but I also ate meat and dairy and eggs back then and ate a crazy amount of protein, which kept me fuller.

Thanks! :)",0

Why doesn't someone prove that calories in/out is bullshit?,0,pdn1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/pdn1s/why_doesnt_someone_prove_that_calories_inout_is/,9,1328590389.0,"The claim around here is that the whole ""cut your calories"" means of weight loss doesn't work. People here claim that it isn't how much we're eating but what we're eating. The culprit here is carbohydrates. The claim is that by limiting one's carbohydrates, they will experience weight loss that is natural. All along, it was just all of these ""unnatural carbs"" and ""sugar"".

Why doesn't someone prove this? Why doesn't someone go to a doctor and do the calculations required to adjust for their metabolism, and then do keto while surpassing their caloric intake by double. Hell, why not double? If it's simply nothing but carbs causing the excess weight and the calories in/calories out theory is bullshit, then why not do double? If you still lose weight, then I will be convinced.

I did keto for a few weeks. Granted, my food choices were pretty shitty (I ate bacon and hamburger all day long) I did notice that I lost some weight. It was probably water. Keto? I don't know, but I did notice that *slashing my carb intake resulted in a pretty significant drop in my calories as a result*. I think that's the meat of every diet. It ultimately results in a caloric deficit ""behind the scenes"" and people attribute the weight loss to some other factor that was only a ""cover"", so to speak.

It's like the guy who ate nothing but twinkies and still lost weight because he cut his calories while doing it. It would be like him not saying that the caloric deficit was the cause of his weight loss, and it was instead accredited to the consumption of twinkies. That's what I see going on with keto. So, anyone of you (rich?) overweight or obese people looking to try keto want to simultaneously prove its worth? Go on the diet and eat double your necessary calories. If you lose weight, again, I'll be convinced.",1

Yesterday I had an epiphany. 

We've all been there: ""I know you don't eat sugar but my wife made these brownies and you should try one!""  ""I know you can't have carbs but a couple beers won't hurt!""  ""I know you're on a diet, but one donut won't kill you!""... ad infinitum...

I've heard it all. I'm a programmer and my coworkers pretty much subsist on carbs alone.

I always got angry. Always. Why do they want me to fail? Why can't they just let *me* do things my way? Why do they think they know better than me? Why do they have this ""crab pot mentality?""  (I could go into the psychological theories of why we who are unhappy with ourselves tend to default to anger, but I digress...)

I just realized, that's ALL WRONG.

From a young age we're ALL taught that food is how you bring people together. Breaking bread with someone is a colloquialism found in every language. Norman Rockwell defined family by his portraits of families eating together, and ""teach a man to fish"" is a quote we all say.  Many cultures consider it an insult if you refuse a meal, and pretty much every Italian I've ever met takes it as a personal affront of they aren't allowed to feed you into a coma.

There's one universal truth: if you want to **show someone you care** about them, **share your food.**

These people aren't judging us, they're simply *trying to include us in the only way society has taught them* should *always be okay*.

Often they seem ""angry"" if you refuse, but this isn't anger, it's confusion. This *should* work. It's what they've been taught. Is this guy refusing *because he doesn't want to be included?* Why? Does he not like me? What did I do wrong?

So I had this epiphany yesterday morning when a lady at work brought in her regular batch of carb laden goodies for everyone at work. She knew I would refuse (as I  always did) but came to offer again hoping THIS TIME she could convince me to be included. 

All at once, I realized what was going on. This wasn't judgement on ME. She just couldn't figure out *how to include me*. But she kept trying.

So I smiled big, told her how wonderful everything smelled (and it did) but THEN I broke Rule #1. I explained to her that I'd lost 30lbs. for the first time in 20 years on this diet called ""Keto"" and the only way it works is by keeping my net carbs below 20g a day. I explained how net carbs were calculated, and how going above that caused me to get crazy hungry, making it REALLY hard to get back on track. I explained that it wasn't that I didn't *want* to try her cobbler because I *really* did, and it smelled exactly like my grandma's, but even a spoonful would spike my insulin. 

Then I explained to her that my wife and I have been trying for years to conceive. And in order to do that, I had to ""get my numbers straight"" and this diet was helping me do that.

Not shitting you, she came in today with muffins... a fruit tray... and a sausage quiche.

I could've cried. 

She'd clearly gone home and done some research to figure out how to ""include"" me.

Still haven't told my wife or figured out if I should even write her a personal thank-you, coz I'm still... emotional? (I'm 6' prior army. This is all new territory for me.)

But it's the single nicest thing a co worker has ever done for me, after months of me thinking all the wrong things about her attempts to include me.

---------------------------------  

*Edit: The worst part of this is that tomorrow when my wife wakes up and sees this thread, now I'm going to have to explain to her the quiche I ate and didn't report while she's been so diligent about recording our macros... Did NOT expect this response.  FWIW, pretty sure I didn't eat TOO MUCH quiche.*    

----------------------------------  

*Edit2: I forgot to mention that it was a CRUSTLESS quiche. Completely Keto!*

IIRC, the consensus was that people with similar pack-year of cigarette smoking, which essentially measures how much cigarette a person has smoked so far in his/her life, have similar cancer risk when age and genetic factors are controlled. Quit smoking doesn't appear to lower the risk.

Which means, say two 50 yo people each smoke one pack a day, person A smoked for ten years: from 30yo to 40 and then quit; person B smoked for ten years from 40yo to 50 and is still smoking. Their lung cancer risk is about the same.

While this for some may seem like impending doom - for cigarettes smoked look like harm already done, but that is another topic for another day. Because of this nature, pack-year became a very valuable tool for lung cancer risk calculation and possible screening and early intervention opportunities.

Will there be a equivalent for meat consumption?

My motivation was simple, I wanted to run again. This year has been a tough one for me. Earlier in the year, I had a pretty serious accident which landed me a stay in the ICU for a week and two major surgeries. I had compartment syndrome in my leg and nearly lost my leg and my life because of the severity of the situation. The aftermath left me with extensive nerve damage and a very difficult road to recovery. As someone who always prided themselves in their fitness, this really affected me mentally. I was devastated, and lost my sense of self worth. I fell into a very deep depression but began the long and difficult journey to find my fitness again. 

After months of rehabilitation, I could finally walk again, but it felt impossible to make the transition from walking to running. It’s incredibly frustrating and sad to go from being able to run 10-15km at a time to not being able to run for 5 min. Every workout session left me barely able to walk for up to 5 days afterwards. My muscles were just struggling so much to recover from a session that progress felt like it was at a stand still. After months of fighting this losing battle and losing motivation along the way, I came across The Game Changers on Netflix and decided something had to change. I was baffled by the results. After 2 days on a plant based diet, my max time that I could run without a break doubled, one week later it doubled again. It was unbelievable. It had just never occurred to me that my diet was restricting my rehabilitation so much. Mind you, I was  already vegetarian before the switch, I just cut out dairy and eggs. 

Plant based diet has given me hope. I wake up feeling refreshed without feeling groggy or sore. It’s helped me find joy in life again after getting to a point where I thought I would never be able to be active like I was pre-accident, and the results of the change were almost instant. I hope anyone who might be in a similar situation and on the fence about going plant based will read this and give it a shot like I have. This diet might very well have saved my life when I came to the point of almost ending it all. Thanks for reading guys, just wanted to share my story.

One way that I make oatmeal is to use blended bananas with water for the liquid and soak overnight with fruits, nuts, cinnamon, etc. This looks like a truly whole foods way of making oatmeal which I think tastes good enough for me to be able to stick to long term. I like that you can't taste the bananas but the sweetness of it lifts the entire flavour of the oatmeal from the aggressively bland which raw oats inherently is.


However something that got me thinking is why not use oat milk for the liquid as well. If it all it is is oats and water with solid bits strained out is there really any marginal difference using that liquid vs the liquid of water? It's not intuitive to me that using oat milk would be sub optimal health wise.",0

I used xanthan gum to thicken a broccoli cheddar chicken soup I made the other day, turned out great, but the xanthan gum gave me pause because it clumped weird and didn’t disperse the way I wanted it to. I shrugged it off. I should’ve known, though. Should’ve paid attention.

Tonight I made beef and broccoli and used xanthan gum instead of cornstarch. Big mistake, yuge. Instead of dispersing and thickening, it clumped up into slimy globs of warm gunk, clinging to everything it touched. I overcooked the steak trying to fix the sauce and turned what would’ve been a delicious meal (HAD I JUST USED CORNSTARCH) into a gummy, rubbery slop with broccoli. I powered through a plate though, because I’ll be goddamned if I’m wasting steak and mama didn’t raise no quitter.

I can still feel it and taste it, despite having an 86% intense dark Ghiradelli square to cleanse the palate. Is this gonna be forever?

On Tuesdays, we get to brag a little. 😆 But to be honest, it isn’t about the bragging. It’s about being proud and confident in your skin for once! It’s about loving where you are in your journey and appreciating your body for the astonishing things it can do and your mind for being so strong to fight for it.
We are capable of AMAZING things.

I feel bad that everytime we go out, it seems like her weight loss is overshadowed by mine, and people only seem to want to comment on me. Now obviously we are losing weight for so many health reasons and not to just get compliments, but I really feel like she's done so well, that I want to show her this thread in the morning after she pulls another all nighter at work and watch her face as she sees all the nice things you internet strangers have to say.

Take the recent “energy balls” post: dark chocolate, peanut butter, and agave syrup. Agave syrup is not a whole plant food but then again they put their little out in there by saying “or other liquid sweetener”.  
Dark chocolate, however, needs to be addressed. Is it vegan? Absolutely. Is it WFPB or oil-free? Well that’s debatable. Cocoa liquor (cocoa solids and cocoa butter liquified together) is a whole plant food, technically, however the cocoa butter is so high in saturated fat that I would not consider it “oil free”. Plus, where’s the rest of the fiber and pulp from the original plant? That sounds like it’s not a whole food. Is it free of added oils? Sure, but that’s not what this diet and lifestyle are after. It’s about eating as healthfully as possible and normalizing a huge shot of concentrated saturated fat seems counterproductive. I just see this as dishonest presentations of junk foods masquerading as health food. And on top of the cocoa butter you’re adding a sweetener and even more saturated fat with the peanut butter. This sounds like something that would elevate insulin resistance, inflammation, and contribute to obesity/diabetes/insulin resistance, not healthfulness.  
I pick on that recipe heavily as an example, but I see lots of recipes in this community fall through the cracks because pseudo-healthy vegan products and recipes keep sneaking into the front lines. I think we need to exercise more diligence and self-policing to curb these unhealthy bleed overs.  
Coconut oil, agave syrup, coconut milk, cocoa butter, soy protein isolates, pea protein isolates, seitan, TVP, vegan butters, vegan cheeses (the majority are not WFPB and super high in saturated fats), refined grains like white flour, fruit juices, stevia, Monkfruit, artificial sweeteners, sugar (I couldn’t give a flying %*# if it’s processed with or without bone)... these are not health foods and not WFPB.",0

This is not a sub that likes discussing science. Thank you for your downvotes for, eh, reasons? This sub is such a disappointment...**

Hello all,

This post is geared towards those in this group who either do quantified self experiments. This post is not about weight loss.

Inspired by dr Longo's fast mimicking diet I'm putting together a semi-fast protocol and would love feedback from likeminded keto experimenters.

Below a copy/paste from my personal notes:

----

This post describes the experimentation protocol we're using for a 5 day (120 hour) fast. Strictly speaking this is not a pure fast since we will be consuming calories. The rationale for this experiment is to attempt to develop a fast-like protocol that brings the body into ketosis deeply and sustainably for the purpose of longevity.

Inspiration for this experiment are the ketosis research by Dom D'Agostino and the fast-mimicking diet developed by dr Valter Longo.

Abreviations:

- MCT, medium chain triglycerides
- C8 MCT, MCT of C8 length, in this protocol specifically caprylic acid with a caloric value of 899 kCal per 100 grams
- BHB, beta-hydroxybutyrate

## Basic protocol

Materials:

- Abbott Precision Optium Neo with BHB strips
- C8 MCT oil

Rationale: the Optium Neo is a consumer accessible device with compatible ketone strips. No other devices were considered. The C8 oil was chosen based on research indicating that it is the most effective oil for reaching and maintaining ketosis.

Measurements:

- BHB & glucose (fasted) 1h after waking
- BHB & glucose 6h after waking (1h after MCT)

Rationale: having a baseline fasted measurement and a measurement in the digestion window of the MCT oil. Ideally one would test more, but we considered the cost of BHB strips prohibitive for more than 2 tests a day.

Consumption:

- 20g MCT 1 hour after waking (after fasted HB measurement)
- 20g MCT 3 hours after waking
- 20g MCT 5h after waking (1h before second measurement)
- 20g MCT 8h after waking
- 20g MCT 11h after waking
- 10g MCT 14h after waking

Rationale: a maximum total of 1000 kCal a day as prescribed by doctor Longo's fast mimicking diet approach comes down to about 111 grams of our C8 MCT.

No significant calories will be consumed from any source other than C8 medium chain triglyceride oil.

## Non-caloric consumption

Aside from MCT oil the following may be consumed ad libitum:

- Coffee (no sugar, milk or other caloric additives)
- Tea (no sugar, milk or other caloric additives)
- Water",1

The day before yesterday, I had an extra meal and then gained 3 lbs. I also started started BPC and now I'm up 8 lbs in two days. Gross.

I want to find self control. I overeat on keto foods and then I can't sleep at night because I ate too much. (falling asleep feels great)

I'm in grad school. I turn 30 next month. Ugh. No kids, no boyfriend. I've tried a few months' worth of diet programs. I've tried herbal wraps. I've done B12 shots. I've hovered at the same weight my entire adult life.

I've been doing lazy keto for the past few years. My usual fasts are 2-3 days. When I did a food journal back in November, I realized that I still ate carb-ish meals 2-3 times per week. It was never rice/noodles/bread, but I would have fried chicken or some pita crisps. Since then, I've completely absolutely omitted carbs; I'm certain that I'm in ketosis now.

I'm fairly green when it comes to exercise. I have bouts where I workout regularly and then stop. For instance, for the past two days, I did HIIT; however, I am deathly afraid of losing muscle, so I refuse to do fasted cardio. I overate before and after my workouts. I'm currently on the progressive strength training SL5x5 program; I'll be continuing this through the fast.

Today was my off-day for exercise. I just had a meal of 1 cup vegetables and 6 oz poached chicken breast.

This is purely for fat loss. I want to reset my relationship with food and really force my body to burn off some excess. I will be consuming BPC, broth, and plain coffee/tea.",1

Please remember your first 10-15 pounds are water weight and will come off quickly.,31,twt39,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/twt39/friendly_reminder_this_is_not_some_miracle_cure/,91,1337592932.0,"I've seen SO many people lately going ""this is too good to be true. I lost 10 pounds the first week!!!!11!""

I get tired of reminding them that it's just water weight, and to expect the results to taper off.


This is not some miracle diet. This is you taking care of yourself. Keto doesn't work because ketones burn the fat away super quick, or because carbs cause an insulin response which stores fat. It works because it keeps you more full for longer periods of time on fewer calories.

You can expect (after the initial dive in water weight) to lose the standard 1-3 lb a week unless you're extremely overweight and have a lot to lose. 

I don't want people to get excited when one month hits and they've ""only"" lost 21 pounds, since the first 15 came off in the first week. That's still incredible progress. Hell, 10 pounds a month is incredible progress.

Try to remember that this is a lifestyle change (at least it should be). The weight will come off.


And now I'm rambling, sorry.

**EDIT: I'd like to make something clear. I'm NOT saying this to be discouraging. I completely agree it's a fantastic boost to morale and health to drop those first pounds, and good on you for sticking through the keto-flu to get that initial loss. The only thing I'm trying to say is to be AWARE of what that weight was, so you don't expect the same rate of loss the entire time.**",1

I've been doing Keto for about 2 1/2 months now. I noticed some weight loss about a month ago but then I hit a stagnation period. I also feel like I'm not making the correct dietary choices and have been losing too little or not at all compared to the folks posting here. Let me breakdown my meals:

&#x200B;

Breakfast: Black coffee, maybe a teaspoon or so of peanut butter with some pecans/almonds. 

Lunch: 1 block of tofu (used to be 1/2 a block of tofu), with some broccoli. Top that off with a slice of cheese and then Chipotle Mayo. I tend to put quite a bit of Chipotle mayo. 

Dinner: Cauliflower Rice and a chicken breast, with cheese and chipotle mayo again. 

Snack: I try to have these keto bars which are 5g net carbs or some peanut butter for snacks (another good alternative is keto ice cream bars). 

&#x200B;

I used to have a 3-egg omelet with half an avocado for lunch and half a block of tofu for dinner, but was getting tired of eggs and needed to switch things up.   

I am currently (according to my home scale) 210 pounds although I'm going to the Doc tomorrow for a checkup so I should get a more accurate weight there. I do not feel 210 pounds with my belly. 

Is there any advice you guys could give me? I'm thinking of buying a food scale if that could help but I feel really lost, I really want the same gains I see everyone posting here, especially because this diet is good for my NAFLD.  Sorry for the long post, but I know if there's anywhere I can post about this without feeling embarrassed or worried someone will super judge me into quitting, it's here. I love you guys a lot, just need some help, please! 

&#x200B;

side note: I think the diet has reduced my NAFLD because I'm not noticing any more heartburn with spicy food and I've been gorging there.",1

I didn't want my funny diet (although she's fully supportive!) getting in the way and making eating difficult, so I dropped keto for a day.. It was amazing! This continued into Saturday though, in which I ate everything in sight.. A full giftbox of chocolates, takeaway pizza and a bag of cookies to name but a few. The list is actually much longer, and I probably ate over 10,000kcals per day.

Anyway, that's the bad bit. Today, it's back to business. I'm not worried about the past two days.. It was great to get all that cheating out of my system (Or into, technically!) after sticking to keto religiously for the past 6 weeks. I started with a black coffee and a small amount of coconut oil. Looooads of water all day long - I peed about 8 times by 11am - and some lovely salami for lunch. Then came the gym.

I thought the best way to burn the glucose quickly was to do some cardio. And damn, did I do some cardio! I usually warm up with a 20 minute run before doing weights, and that wears me out quite a bit. I set the timer to 20 minutes and started running. At one minute remaining, I added another 5 minutes. And then another. And another. 

I RAN FOR AN HOUR.

Hooooooly crap, how?! I covered just over 10km, 949kcals burned. So that's it; my non-scale victory. Happy days :)

This is mostly for my own catharsis, its long but I get to the point eventually.  

This has been a big two weeks for me.  

A bit of background.  I've been morbidly obese since I was a little child- typical obese parents passing on horrible practices to their offspring.  Living with the nicknames like ""Shamu"" in highschool heaped on a big old pile of depression on top of that.  I spent my life being told I was ugly, lazy, weak willed, and should be ashamed of myself.  I was hated, reviled and loathed.  I was the one who hated myself the most, I internalised all those hurtful things and became the meanest, nastiest, hater of myself of them all.  

Every day I call myself names, put myself down, tell myself I'm lazy, ugly, a waste of space and resources, that I'm weak willed, that if my husband didn't need me I'd be better of not being here at all.

I'm crying now.  Not because I'm calling myself those things, or feeling that they are true.  Because I'm not.  For the first time in my life I'm not.  I'm proud of myself.  I feel powerful.  I feel empowered.  I feel like I'm worth living.

I am a stay at home wife, full time care-giver for my severely disabled husband.  I do it all.  24/7 care for hubs (I love him- it never feels like work, it just takes a lot of time and effort =] )  Laundry, Housework, Gardenwork, Petcare, Home maintenance, Shopping, Dishes, Cooking, etc...  I do it all on my own.  My husband looks at me like I have broccoli coming out of my ears when he hears me putting myself down- he tells me I'm not lazy, that I do two full time jobs all the time.  But I couldn't understand him, I couldn't hear him.  I just kept on dragging my way through day after day putting myself down, unhappy, unhealthy.  

With my weight a severe hindrance to just about everything, and my husband's disability progressing in severity, I recently realised if I didn't get myself healthy I wasn't going to be able to care for him properly for much longer.  It terrified me, to think of letting the person I love so much down.  I kept hearing about KETO on Reddit in so many places.  I've tried so many things, so many times.  I'd given up trying to get healthy.  But I just went for it- took that leap of faith- I don't know why or how.  I don't have much strength for myself, but for hubs I seem to be able to move mountains.

I spent a run up week ordering KETO food supplies, and tossing/using up anything in the cupboards that isn't for hubs' special diet.  Then I jumped straight into the deep end.  I'm always so tired.  I never really have the time/energy to care for myself.  Trying to keep our little boat afloat just wipes me out every single day.  By the time I get a chance to take a break for food I'd find myself cramming down any processed, pre-packaged, sugary/carby things I could get into me quick and dirty.  It was all I had the strength to do.

But not the last two weeks.  I've dug deep- deeper than I knew I had strength in me to find.  I've been cooking myself keto meals.  I cried last night having dinner- it was just so nice to have a hot meal instead of a bowl of microwaved rice or dry cheerios.  I found out I love zucchini!  I found out how nice it is to make some effort for myself, I never felt like I deserved it before, or else I just didn't have the strength to do it.  I'm on the bottom of the TO DO list.  I just stopped cutting the list short- I may be at the bottom but darnit I AM on the list!

I know it doesn't seem like much to just cook nice hot food for yourself and enjoy it.  It's a lot for me.  Especially knowing that its the first steps, the first days, in a long long journey to a much better physical and emotional place.  I baked zucchini walnut bread yesterday with almond flour.  Today I made a KETO casserole.  

Last week I sliced the bottom of my foot pretty badly.  I've been limping/shuffling around using a cane and screaming/sobbing from pain as I carried on with the chores and caring for my husband.  And I still stuck to KETO.  When I wanted to just grab something easy, when I wanted to get off my foot and not be in the kitchen making that extra effort.  I did it anyway.  I am STRONG.

After all these really hard changes to get started with KETO, after having to carry on with it through my every day exhaustion, and then the excruciating pain from this injury I am still going.  I will never call myself lazy or weak again!

To HECK with all the people who called me names, to heck with anyone who calls me lazy or weak, and especially a great big to HECK with me not thinking I am able to do anything I want.  I'm going to do this!  I'm already doing it!  If I can do it now when things are pretty rock bottom, I know I can stick with it when things get bettter.

If you actually read all the way through this, thank you, I wish I had a reward for you =]

_____
I'm absolutely speechless.  Thank you all SO much for the outpouring of kindness, support, encouragement, and all the tips and hints.  I wish I could thank every single one of you, my new KETO family, for your love and support but I'd be here for a week! =]  I love you all, we're all in this together and we're going to make it to our goals!!

I promise there will be updates.  I did the unthinkable this morning when I found my inbox flooded with comments.  I took some before pics.  Maybe someday Ill have a before/after post if I have the progress to report and the courage to post it. KCKO my new wonderful friends!

PS  I'm astounded, I didn't think anyone would even read my post and now its been gilded on TOP of all the love and encouragement.  Thank you internet stranger =]  Being worthy of that show of confidence and support will just motivate me even more to keep going!

[NSV] Got THE LOOK from the sales assistant for grabbing the wrong size. Went from L to S in about two months.,1374,7pnu9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7pnu9e/nsv_got_the_look_from_the_sales_assistant_for/,78,1515703488.0,"Yesterday I went shopping for sports clothes and had a very nice lady helping me out. I instantly liked a pair of leggings and she said “ok, I’ll go grab your size” while I kept on browsing. Found a t-shirt I liked but they didn’t have my size (which is I guessed was Medium since my old clothes got a tat too big for me). So I grabbed the size Large and by that time the lady was back with my leggings. She saw me holding that Large tshirt, gave me the “oh she’s useless and I’m tired” look and said that this is not my size. Being the stubborn and offended me I started saying that they don’t have Medium so I got the Large one. She told me that I am not bigger than her, she is size S and she’s good with sizes. She then reached over and handed me the Small size and said that I am apparently size S. In the changing room discovered that she also brought me S sized leggings. All fit well but the tee wasn’t that nice so I got a different one. But this is not the best part.

The best part is that my biggest NSV is all the gained confidence. On the way back home I was thinking to myself how those leggings were stretchy so they don’t count and how I just got lucky with that tee.

But, last night we had company over.  Prime situation for keto failure.  But instead, I had about 2.5 glasses of malbec, two spoonfuls of gelato, and was otherwise keto-compliant.

But - BUT - there was nothing about it that made me rethink keto or slip back into eating tons of carbs.

I'm so used to keto after only a month that I couldn't get close to finishing anything, whereas before it would have all been gone and the craving would have lingered. I had no desire to keep eating beyond a ""normal"" portion, and in fact, had to stop eating dessert because it was just too sweet. This morning, there was no yearning for toast or pancakes - just eggs!

So I sent my teenage daughter to go grab milk and told her that I'll be in the produce section. This task I sent my daughter on should have only taken 3 maybe 4 minutes tops! So you can imagine that after 10 minutes go by, I'm wondering where the heck is that kid? As soon as the thought crosses my mind, my cell phone rings, I pull it out of my pocket and see it's my daughter calling, but before I could hit the talk button, the phone stops ringing. I didn't have time to hit redial because further down the aisle I see my daughter walking towards me. I asked her if she had trouble finding the milk we get since it took her so long. She said, no, she just had trouble finding me. I asked her how could she have trouble finding me when I told her I was going to be in the produce department. She said she did look, 2x in fact, and went to check the other aisles. On her 3rd attempt to find me, she stood at the end of the aisle of the produce section and called my phone, heard my ringer and that's when she was finally able to locate me. I told her it didn't make sense because there was only 3 other people in the produce area besides myself and the store wasn't crowded or busy at all. Her response was: ""Mom, to be honest, I had a hard time finding you because I was looking for someone wider."" She explained that she had seen me the 3x she came to the produce section but it didn't register in her head that I was her mom because she was looking for someone bigger.
Holy crap! That blew my mind and my jaw just about hit the floor! I honestly didn't know how to feel or what to say. A mix of emotions washed over me. It was a combination of happy and proud, but guilt and shame...and all at the same time. 
It got me thinking, my 16 year old daughter, (who is also my first born), had seen me in a heavier state her whole life because it was after her birth that I started to put on weight, and this heavier state was normal to her. I may be an excellent mom to both of my kids but I did them a great disservice by letting them grow up thinking that my obesity was normal and okay.

Even though I was fat and miserable to the point where it hurt to stand for more than a minute, I didn't make a New Year's resolution to loose weight because I didn't believe it was possible. In May I decided to try keto just for the summer. If it didn't work at least I'd tried. Well it's December, 70 lbs and I'm still going strong!

It's crazy how my weight colored every decision- didn't want to go to the store because my back hurt too much to walk so I would do fast food, the holidays were especially hard as I sat out of all sorts of fun outings and festivals and told myself it was because I wanted to save money but in reality I was winded just walking to the car (and would end up spending more ordering food delivery).

Anyways I knew walking had become easier since May but since I'm a nanny and spend most of my time in stretchy yoga pants I hadn't really registered how much weight I'd lost until I started getting those Facebook memories. Pics from a year ago started popping up and I was seriously shocked. 

I feel so much healthier and though it sounds cliché keto has really given me my life back. Now I can think about outings and activities without worrying about being in pain the whole time. It's like a different world and I love it!",1

*Weight lost in Year 1:* 111 lbs 

*Weight lost in Year 2:* 39.2 lbs

I wish I had remembered to take measurements this morning! From the last time I measured (mid-February 2019), these are my losses: 5 inches in my bust (43 to 38), 9 inches in my waist (41 to 32), and 11 inches in my hips (55 to 44). Pant size went from like a 22 to a 10 (maybe 8?)--I'm still wearing 12s that are way too big for me [\#cheapgirlprobs](https://imgur.com/t/cheapgirlprobs). Tops went from a 3XL to a medium.   

*Goals:* get in the gym and do some weight lifting/weight training. Are those the same thing? Idk. I want my thighs to squish watermelons. And I want to build my booty back up. RIP butt. I also want those abs that are starting to peek through to make their way out.   

***FAQ:***  

**What’d you eat?** 

* I would typically have my meals follow this formula: protein + leafy green (or some kind of veggie) + cheese. Dinner tonight is going to be butter chicken, cauliflower rice, and some spinach on the side. I love spinach. Dinner last night (most nights) is a quesadilla (with some kind of meat inside) using a low-carb tortilla (La Banderita makes the best, imho), and a bunch of veggies on the side: cucumbers, spinach, pickled jalapenos, etc. I like sides.   

**Do you work out?**  

* I worked out 5x a week for like three weeks in April 2017, then didn’t do anything for a few months, then started cycling and belly dance sporadically in October/November 2017. Then I did Krav Maga for like a month or two at the end of 2017, early 2018. Since January/February 2018, I've just stuck with cycling--I try to go at least 3 times a week. It doesn't always happen.  Considering most of my weight loss happened in Year 1, the majority of my weight loss occurred without much exercise.   

**Did you cheat?**  

* Short answer: yes. Longer answer: Yes, but not very often. I didn't do carb-ups, or whatever. I typically cheat around vacations. Essentially, all of my cheats were planned. I went into a cheat knowing it was going to be a cheat period, and I ended the cheat when I said it would end. Always felt bloated and sluggish, but when in Italy............

**Where are your stretch marks?** 

* They're there! I've been fat my whole life, so my marks aren't dark or red, they are light and skin colored at this point. They blend in with the poor lighting and bad camera quality.   

**Do you have loose skin?** 

* I sure do! Most of it is on my inner thighs, as cycling has slimmed those suckers down quite a bit. My inner thighs are super wrinkly. You can see some loose skin on my knee in my after picture. My inner arms are becoming bat wings--if I move too quickly, they slap me and I can hear them clap. LOL. My tummy doesn't look too loose when I stand up straight, but if I'm doing a plank BOIIIIIIIII it's loose as heck.  Even my butt is saggy and has loose skin. It's quite unfortunate, tbh. I'd like to get plastic surgery in the future to remove the loose skin and do something about my deflated boobs.  

&#x200B;

Um, I think that is it for now. If you have any other questions, I would be more than happy to answer. Keto is my lifestyle for good. I feel best eating keto, and I don't plan on going back to my old eating habits. If I hadn't stumbled upon this subreddit in February 2017 as I was desperately trying to find a way to lose weight, I wouldn't be here today.

[Face Gains 242 to 199 lbs](https://imgur.com/a/d7UFtS1)

I'm 32/M/5'10, and I haven't started any exercise routines yet. I do lazy keto with a limit of \~25 carbs. I don't count macros religiously, but I've done Atkins/Keto enough times (and did track) to know roughly what I can and can't fit within my goals. My goal weight is 175. The first picture is from January 18th of this year, when I was 242. I gained a bit more once Covid started, but didn't weigh myself for the first few weeks of keto, so I'm not sure exactly how much I've lost. I started keto in earnest on May 18th, so it's been about 20 weeks.

Back in 2015 I successfully lost about 65 pounds on keto, but eventually got complacent and got too into craft beer, and gained it all back. I've tried countless times since then but never could stay on the wagon. My downfall was always lunch at work - the boss ordering pizzas, or my coworkers going out for Chinese, or just me wanting to get out of the office and hitting a restaurant. Working from home has helped my willpower immensely - I just got in a routine and stuck to it.

It is also pivotal that my girlfriend has been eating keto the whole time, making awesome and creative dinners so I never feel like I'm missing out. She has really been incredible, and she's lost 15 lbs as well!

Some other things I found very helpful this time around:

* Quest bars and cookies are much more available in my area now, with some gas stations and corner stores carrying them. It's nice to have a snack I can grab when I'm in a rush.
* Hard seltzers have really been a game-changer for me. We drink relatively often, and hard liquor just gets me way past buzzed way too quickly. Several attempts at keto have failed at a BBQ or holiday party when I switched to beer. Now I can just bring some 0 carb Corona Seltzers and be guilt-free and not sloppy.
* Mission low-carb tortillas; there are some that are 4 net carbs. I eat one of these almost every day with a bunch of lunchmeat and cheese for lunch. We've also made burritos, quesadillas, cheesesteaks; we've cut them up and fried them to make tortilla chips. Sometimes we order Italian subs or a Chipotle bowl and just dump all the contents into a wrap.
* I jumped into the chaffle craze with both feet - for a month or two. They were good (especially when I made protein-powder-fried-chicken and chaffles), but at some point they weren't worth the effort to make for me.
* Keto seems to be much more mainstream than it was 5-6 years ago, and I'm really enjoying all the low carb options that are available at grocery stores now. Pre-cut zoodles, frozen mashed or riced cauliflower, cauliflower crusts for pizza; we even got some hearts-of-palm pasta and made a Bolognese and a lasagna. It's been fun experimenting with all this stuff, but I wouldn't say any of it is a staple of our diet except cauliflower rice.

I made a change in January of this year to lose fat and turned to keto. Starting at 245, I'm now at 198lbs. Went from a UK 20 (the dress here is 3xl) and now a UK 12-14. I'm not sure of my weight in the before pic but I can see the difference. I chucked it on without undoing the zip, had it falling off my shoulders and it now falls below my knees. Still a long way to go, but this morning I'm feeling great. ",1

Now a year later I have managed to shave 150 off with the help of this group and keto in general. 

Today is also special because for the first time since I was in 5th grade I was able to fit into a 2xl t-shirt. I haven’t been able to buy clothes at a regular store since I was literally a child. My entire world is changing and I feel like I’m truly living my life for the first time.

This is my second round of doing keto. Fell off the wagon a couple years back after losing a decent amount of weight, went through some hardships earlier this year and decided when the lockdown started that I was going to do it again and not let myself re-gain the weight this time.

Since the end of March I've been following a moderate ketogenic diet (i only say moderate because I don't physically track my macros, I've been kinda estimating in my head throughout the day), and I've been trying to walk as much as I can since there's not much else to do.

Current weight: 156lb (less than I weighed in high school nearly 10 years ago!)

Hello, this is my second time ever posting in this subreddit and my first time posting a photo here...I'm an irrationally shy person lol. In September of 2016, I promised myself I'd become a healthier me. I am 75lbs down so far, and I wanted to challenge myself to come out of my shell and become a *happier* me as well.

It was actually extremely hard for me to look through photos of myself for the ""before"" part (and there honestly aren't that many to begin with!) I still have a ways to go on this journey of mine but every day its getting easier and easier for me to feel comfortable in my own skin. I am so grateful for this community (even if I've been a lurker for the most part), I've found so much inspiration and knowledge here. 

EDIT: Wow. I'm an sincerely shocked at the overwhelming love you guys have shown me. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much from the bottom of my heart. Keto has saved my life, I was pre-diabetic before I started, I also have PCOS/insulin resistance. I'm happy to say on my most recent blood work/testing my doctor was floored, she said everything was ""night and day."" In many ways, this has also transformed how I feel about myself as a person. I've hidden away for so long from friends and family, and now its like I have a new chance at life. I am continuing to work hard on my journey and I thank you for all your support and kind words. They truly mean a lot.",1

&nbsp;

I've been on my weightloss journey for just over 2 years now.  I started at my all time high of 378 pounds in August 2014 and now currently down to 232 pounds....making it a total of 146 pounds lost so far (with still quite abit to lose).  The first few months I was just reducing portions then hit a stall, then discovered keto early last year, and have been strict keto for 1yr and 7 months now and planning to stay keto for life.     

&nbsp;

My number 1 reason for staying keto is because it basically cured my binge eating disorder that I had since childhood, for as long as I can remember I ate junk food to the point of bursting (then blacking out due to carb crash) and no ""diet"" on earth ever cured me of it, I always just kept wanting more to basically the point of near death (Getting up to 378 pounds is no way to live) and I was terrified I was going to one day end up on my 600lb life.     

I stumbled upon keto online and it sounded absolutely crazy to me, but I had tried everything and failed and before completely giving up hope decided to give it one last shot....and I've NEVER looked back.  I always tell people that keto saved my life and I really do mean it...and have deep deep gratitude for the r/keto and r/xxketo community (and other keto related online groups), because they kept me going from day 1, reading success story after success story (especially of those starting out at higher weights of 300+ pounds) really helped keep me inspired and let me know that if I stick with it that maybe it would be me one day posting my own success story.  I still have a long way to go but for the first time in my life know that I can make it to goal.     

&nbsp;

Foodwise, in case anyone asks, I usually keep it simple. I prep my protein (usually diced chicken or ground beef) and store in portions in the freezer and pop in the microwave and with whatever veg is on hand (usually broccoli or cauliflower or green beans or kale etc).  For quick meals I make eggs.  I cook everything in mostly coconut oil or clarified butter because I like the taste.  I freakin love cheese and add it to everything or as a snack.  I also love avocadoes.  I add butter to my protein and veges.  I use stevia to help sweeten my herbal teas and use it to sweeten my keto mug cakes that I have almost daily for breakfast (just *my* personal preference).  I also love greek yoghurt as well.  These are just the things that have worked for me and helped sustain my keto journey for so long and of course have gone tweaking things along the way learning what worked best for *me* as it will be different for everyone.    I weigh everything I eat and track my calories and carbs using myfitnesspal (again just what has worked for *me*).  

Exercisewise: I workout at the gym on average 4 times a week, a mix of strength training and cardio, but I honestly attribute 99% of my weightloss to what I eat rather than my workouts.  

&nbsp;


Afew benefits so far:-  
- Binge eating disorder is long gone (i firmly believe if *i* ever go back to carbs I'll be back on the binge train so never going back!).  
- My high blood pressure is gone
- sleep apnea  gone  
- I have lost a ridiculous amount of inches round my waist (ummm and i have a freakin waist now and can wear belts for the first time in my life!).  
- I breathe easier now and have so much more energy  
- I don't get carb crashes so no more naps during the afternoon  
- I can cross my legs, easily do pedicures, kneel, get up from chairs without needing to hold onto something and the list goes on.  
- I have lost a whole shoe size, my fingers and wrists got smaller (who'd have thought lol) as my rings and bracelets are now falling off my fingers and hands lol.  
- I actually enjoy shopping now and after rehauling my entire wardrobe for the first time I have a coulourful and trendy choice of outfits to pick from daily and it feels really good to finally have said goodbye to my all black baggy clothes that I wore for decades!

&nbsp;

Drawbacks?
None that I can think of, unfortunately I do have loose skin but starting at my kind of weight (and height short only 5'0), it was inevitable and would have happened no matter what ""diet"" i'd have chosen.  The loose skin sucks yes, but what I have is my life and health back and wouldn't trade that in for anything.

I debated if I should make this such a long post but figured it may help motivate someone out there who is in doubt of this way of eating, I was hesitant at the start too, but gave it my all and now so so grateful for where I have gotten to, keto works!

&nbsp;

TL:DR; Keto saved my life!

[Side by side](https://i.imgur.com/eLB4mxi.jpg)

[And finally here's one with a shirt on](https://i.imgur.com/EdixtU0.jpg)

So far this is ***ALL KETO, NO EXERCISE***. Started keto on June 20, 2017 with the goal of just being less fat. I wanted to hit 220-230 punds, I wanted to move down from XXL to L in shirt size, I wanted to go from a size 44 pants to maybe a 38 or a 36 on a good day. 

Well, here I am, 9 months and 1 day later, weighing 207.2, wearing a medium shirt and a size 34 pants. You heard that right, folks, the shirt I'm wearing in that final pic is a fucking ***medium***. There's an episode of Sienfeld where it reveals that Jerry wears down the 4 in his size 34 pants and writes a 2 over them so he can pretend he's a size 32, so I'm also officially Jerry Sienfeld sized.

ALSO I HAD DIABETES AND I DON'T (officially cleared by my doctor a few weeks ago)

**From then to now:** 

Started with keto for about 6 months and lost a bunch of weight until I plateaued at around 60-70 pounds lost. Started IF (Intermittent Fasting for the uninitiated - my strategy was just to not eat until lunch, which is about 7-8 hours after I wake up) around January and the weight loss picked right back up again. I had no planned cheat days, just cheat bites/snacks here and there, and maybe a couple of days where I had more cheat bites than non-cheat bites, but such is life. 

**Future:**

Now that i've hit 9 months and the excess weight is pretty much gone, it's time to finally hit the gym I guess :/. My wife's been going to the gym since before we started dieting (She's doing awesome, too, btw, but I'd rather not speak for her here). Since she gets to bring a guest for free, I went with her for the first time last night. I had a good time but pushed a little too hard for my first time and had to call it quits earlier than I wanted to. But, I'll still be going back tonight.

I'll also be keeping a close eye on how it goes with both IF and working out, but I have a feeling I wont be able to maintain both for long.

And now that I've surpassed my goal? 

It didn't hit me until I weighed 217 to check my BMI progress and I'm in the 'overweight' range. The chart showed 190 pounds being at the top of my 'healthy' range, so I originally decided to make that my new goal.

Instead of setting my new goal to 190, however, I have decided to put more effort into my fitness than my weight at this point. I will still be doing everything the same, but I do not want a scale obsession to get in the way of my actual health. 

**Future, but more future:**

As I mentioned above that I had been diabetic, I'll probably stay low-carb for life, even if 20g carbs a day starts to become too low. I'd also be curious to hear what anyone else is eating that has hit their goal and is maintaining.

I knew that losing weight was going to make me feel better, but I didn't realize how much was going to change! I have so much more confidence now, my energy levels are through the roof, my hormones are in check and I have way less mood swings, my skin has cleared up a lot,  and to top it off I seriously LOVE all of the food I get to eat on keto! Its been a challenging year of growth and change but I am so happy that I found Keto and i'm never going back to how things were before!

I’ve also decided to take my weight loss to the next level and I’m meeting with a personal trainer today. Gotta channel all that extra keto energy somehow!

I've been dieting on and off for what seems like forever and it's been hard to really track my progress because whenever I was tagged in unflattering/realistic pics at a bigger size I'd always untag... so now when I look in the mirror I still see my previous self looking back at me. I feel like I don't have a realistic body image at all. Went digging through my mom's facebook to see if I could find a before picture and found this...  really shocked me but it's great motivation for staying on track! Forgive the filtered snapchat pic, it's just the most recent nearly full-body picture I have. The majority of my weight loss happened over a 1 year timeframe, took a break for a bit but I'm trying to lose another 20.

Went from around a 22/24 to a 10/12, M in tops

I didn't start out specifically on keto, but I was following a similar diet after visiting a nutritionist (higher focus on protein than fat but still low carb) and about 30lbs into the weight loss I discovered keto and switched over. I spent my entire childhood and teen life being fat so it wasn't until this weight loss that I've ever been this size, or a ""healthy"" BMI... rebuilding my wardrobe has been really hard haha.

I eat ~1200cals, <30g carbs, 80g+ fat, try to keep high protein. Not the best at consistent exercise but I do yoga and body weight exercises and live in a major city so I get a decent amount of walking in.

If you’d told me a year and a half ago (before I started Keto) that I’d have the confidence to wear a bikini in public, I’d have said you were crazy. 

Lo and behold, a few weeks ago I bought one to wear on vacation. I had to talk myself out of buying a “back-up” one piece several times. 

Before I started this diet and started stalking r/keto I neverrrrr would have done this. 

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/nEVkmdR) I am this past week wearing a bikini!... And I freaking loved the feeling! 

I would damn near have a panic attack at the thought of just wearing a conservative bathing suit. The last time I was able to work up the nerve to wear one was [3 years ago](https://imgur.com/a/DACPOwt) and it was a dress.

The biggest phenomenon for me, though, is reflecting on my self-perception when I was 106 pounds heavier. I didn’t see my face as being as round. I didn’t think I had a double chin. It was almost as if I perceived my face to look as it does now, but this picture proves that that wasn’t the case.

EDIT: You guys are insane! Thanks a lot for so many nice comments, I honestly was not expecting this post to be seen by so many people.

As there were a lot of questions, I figured it will be best if I write something more about my keto journey and try answering you here.

Please, bear in mind that whatever works for me doesn't necessarily mean it will work for you. We're all different.


F/23/5'2""


The first step in losing my weight was way before I even made a decision about the weight loss. As I've already mentioned in a comment below, it all came down to having a better relationship with myself. I finally, after many years, started realising that I like myself and I genuinely want the best for me. I started learning to observe my emotions, what really makes me happy, brings me joy, excitement, which moments in my life are making me feel proud about myself and what can I do to have more moments like that. I also started observing my negative emotions, eg. what makes me feel down/anxious/worthless(!)/powerless and and if I can find a way to change whatever is causing that. I started prioritising my self-care and wellbeing.

Long story short, after implementing some changes, I also started implementing routines into my life. Started with complex skincare routine, then added daily vitamin and collagen supplementation, language classes 4x/week, daily stretching etc. and THIS is what I think helped me a lot. I realized that  1) I am finally able to do something for me long term 2) it REALLY makes me feel good about myself and I want to keep feeling that way

I knew that my weight was stopping me from doing a lot of things that I wanted to do + I wouldn't feel as comfortable in social situations. I always had this feeling that with the weight that I had I was just not who I'm supposed to be (???)

So I started with keto. [mid April 2020]

[!] DIET:

Well, my first week was just IF to kick-start the whole thing, then I went on keto + IF. 

I'm trying to stick to 1200/1300kcal a day.

I would most of the times try to do 2 meals a day:

First meal around 11/12:

Usually 2/3 bacon rashes, a fried egg or 2, chestnut mushrooms + veggies like spinach, wild rocket, olives, tomatoes etc. Sometimes I'd add mayo, sometimes cheese etc. Most of the days my breakfast would look pretty much the same as I was simply enjoying it 🤷

My second meal would be around 17/18:

Either steak or some creamy chicken, broccoli, a lot of veggies again, maybe a salad with king prawns.

If I feel like snacking on something, I snack on cheese and olives or oven baked pepperoni with jalapenos and cheese.

If I crave something sweet I usually go for low-carb ice cream, sometimes low-carb peanut bars. It's not a clean keto, but it's good for my mental health as it makes me feel like I'm basically not on a diet.

By the end of the first month I did 5 days of egg fast, but I wouldn't say I had some bigger results, the weight was dropping at usual pace.


I drink alcohol once a week - it's usually a red wine, but sometimes I go for gin/vodka/whiskey and that's the only times that I drink soda.

I drink a lot of water, sometimes I add lime/lemon/mint/cucumber for taste.

Once a day I drink water with collagen to help my skin with weight loss shock and just help it in general.

I did cheat during my diet, but although I cheated, I never binged. So even if I had something that was not keto friendly, the portion was never big. And I wasn't obsessing over it. I wanted it, I had a bit of it and it wasn't the end of the world.

I do not obsess over food. Keto was an easier option for me, as even without a diet, I would never buy bread unless some sandwich to-go. I don't like potatoes, I find pasta and rice tasteless and although I would be eating them before, I'm not craving them. 

I like cheese, pepperoni, bacon, mayo etc so on keto I barely feel like I'm on a diet. Especialy since there's so many tasty meals you can have.



[!] EXERCISES

As gyms still not reopened here where I live, I use some YouTube videos to excercise - one time it's tabata, one time something targeting abs + core, then legs + bum etc. I have dumbbell and plates that I use for excercise. I additionally do yoga and care about the whole body flexibility. I excercise 4x a week and stretch most of the days 

It's easier for me to gain muscles as it's more of a regaining - I used to excercise on and off - although in the last few years it was rather off - since I was little, so the muscle memory is there.

If anyone's interested in YT videos I use you can PM me, but I watch them in a few languages. But I don't think that should be a big issue.

I used to do skipping rope and it was great, but with that my boobs would disappear way quicker.





I take magnesium, potassium, calcium, vit D And vit B complex.. everyday.


I do not know what my BF% is.


I had a month or two when I struggled with insomnia, but I think it was a mix of keto and my life situation at that point. Now I sleep like I used to before going on a diet.


I hope I didn't forget about anything, although I probably did 😅",1

This time last year I started pharmacy school. This was an exciting time for me and my wife wanted to get a picture of me leaving for school on my first day. At that time I overall felt like crap and had zero energy. On that day I weighed over 350 pounds. I knew that I needed to do something about my health if I wanted to make it to 40 years old. Lucky for me a friend of mine introduced me to Keto. I was excited because I had watched this friend lose over 90 pounds years before, and now I knew his secret. Today, to commemorate my first day of my second year of pharmacy school, my wife decided to take that exact same picture, only this time I am 130 pounds lighter. I started keto in October and haven't looked back. Before you ask, no I don't work out but I should. I merely go for short walks and eat strict keto. I make sure to hit 10k steps a day and eat under 20g of net carbs, although most days I stay under 10g of net carbs. This diet has completely fixed my relationship with food and has erased my mental fog.

Update: got catcalled for the first time. Two girls call me Vin Diesel and asked for my number 😂

I mean, I guess my title says it all. There's a weird part of me that doesn't really believe the scale \(though I've experienced impostor syndrome a few times now during my keto journey, and that's basically what's happening right now\)... but I'm also just so fucking HAPPY. The scale isn't everything, I know, trust me I know, but this is a very big deal to me. When I got under 400, that was great and all, but I'd been under that many times in past years. But to be under 300, that's a big deal because as I mentioned, I haven't been this low in 13 years.

Keto has been a fantastic tool for me. I've been at it for a year and 3 months. At times it seems like the easiest thing in the world; at other times, it's extremely frustrating and difficult \(this year the scale just hasn't been as kind to me as last year\). But not once have I ever even considered giving up. It's been life\-changing and I cannot stress enough how happy I am to have found this lifestyle. Not just for losing weight, but also for other health benefits.

To those who are maybe just starting, [~~I wrote a post here giving my best tips to keto newbies~~](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7npgzm/what_ive_learned_after_nearly_one_year_of_keto_my/) ~~\(and it seemed well\-received, so I figure I'll link to it here again, in case someone new to keto is reading this and is struggling or has questions\)~~. **EDIT: Unfortunately this post is marked as ""Removed"" and I'm not sure why \(I can still see the post** **when logged in**\*\*\).\*\* **Since some people have messaged me or commented asking me to post it in the comments, I threw it down there. Hopefully that helps out!**

I also am extremely active in the instagram keto community, and have found SO much support on there. So get involved in some sort of keto community \(I'd suggest avoiding Facebook groups as they can be extremely toxic \- this keto subreddit and IG have been the main source of support for me.\)

If you're doing keto and find yourself stalling like I have been, try changing things up. For me, I cut out artificial sweeteners \(still allow erythritol and stevia, rest in peace my sweet Diet Mt. Dew\) and started IF again and immediately lost 6 pounds in a week \(last week\). If I stall again, I'll look into cutting back on dairy a bit \(I've always been a little sensitive to too much cheese, which is so sad\) or other keto foods.

I guess that's it \- I just wanted to share a huge SV for me because I'm now more than halfway to my goal of losing 200 pounds. And then eventually, being under 200 pounds \(which hasn't been the case for me since middle school\). I will get there, this is proof I can do it and will do it. If you're starting off big like me, it may seem daunting at times, but you'll be shocked at how quickly time passes by and the progress you can make in that amount of time.",1

First I went to Nordstrom rack and found one I liked and I wasn't sure what size I am so I grabbed a size 14 and that was too big. I went and looked for a smaller size but they didn't have any, so I left and went to dress barn. Now I also had a budget of max $40 because I didn't want to spend a lot on something I might shrink out of in a few months. Well I kept under budget too my dress ended up being $34 so I think it's a win. 

The girl that was helping me at dress barn was super awesome and walked me around helping me pick out some dresses to try on, I ended up picking this black dress and I first tried on a size 12 and it for really nice, but I was worried about shrinking out of it too soon, so the sales girl looks at me and goes ""do you want to try on a size 10?"" 

It took my brain a few seconds to process that thought but I said yes why not.

Hey y'all! I totally should’ve cleaned the grossness on my mirror before taking pictures this morning, but I was excited about it being my one year anniversary on keto! I’ve lost exactly 111 pounds since starting! 

Start weight: 303.4 lbs
Current weight: 192.4 lbs
Goal weight: ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

FAQ: 

What’d you eat?
I would typically have my meals follow this formula: protein + leafy green (or some kind of veggie) + cheeeesssseeeeee

Do you work out? 
I worked out for like three weeks in April, then didn’t do anything for a few months, then started cycling and belly dance sporadically in October/November. Now I do cycling and Krav Maga regularly (at least 3x a week). Haven’t done belly dance since February, but looking to start again! I would say the majority of my weight loss was done without exercise, though. 

Did you cheat? 
Cheat posts aren't allowed on here, but this answer is on imgur. Basically, yes. I'm not a saint. 

Anyway, I'm suuuuuper happy about the progress I've made so far, and I credit this sub for getting me started! If I hadn't stumbled upon it a year and some change ago, who knows if I'd be here now with these same losses. You guys are awesome, thank you so much! KCKO!",1

Been heavy all my life, hell I was in Vice Magazine for ""Interview with a Fat Guy"".

For the last 10 years of so tried to be alot healthier, got from 450lbs to around 370lbs and stayed there for 5 years or so. Sometime in August of 2012 I found /r/keto and started.

In the period of a year I lost almost all my excess weight no real exercise just keto.

Since hitting my goal weight I've not stopped keto, it's probably gonna be part of my life forever.

I yoyo dieted my entire life and after starting university eventually found myself with binge eating disorder as a result of a very restrictive low carb, low fat diet. 

In August of 2015 I started the ketogenic diet at 229 lbs, thinking it would just be another failure, but I was so wrong. The keto diet completely eliminated my binging tendencies because I never felt restricted, how can you when the foods we get to eat are so delicious and satisfying?! 

I did lazy keto until March 2016 when I began macro tracking to keep the weight coming off. By November of 2016 I hit my ultimate goal weight of 140lbs, ate at maintenance for a couple of weeks and then moved into my very first bulk! I have since put on a few pounds and I'm feeling fantastic. 

In terms of exercise- I was in crossfit from the beginning of my journey until September 2016 when I switched over to lifting/cardio on my own. I'm in the gym lifting 6 days a week now and I couldn't be happier.

So many people ask me if I'm planning on reincorporating carbs now that I'm done losing weight but my answer is always the same. ""Why mess with a good thing?"" After a lifetime of struggling to find a way to be healthy that felt natural and sustainable to me, I will never give up this way of eating. 

A huge thank you to this amazing community for all of the knowledge and support you provide. I'm so grateful to have found you guys and to be a part of such a great thing.",1

I don't want to tell a long sad story that is the story of many of our lives when it comes to weight here. I was ALWAYS a chubby kid. I was always very active, but always heavy. I'm 6' 2"" and at one time I weighed 396 lbs. Somewhere around the 370ish range, in June of 2014, I read Dr Davis' book Wheat Belly. I started eating keto. I lost about 50 lbs in the first two months! By September of 2015, I was down to about 190lbs, which I have effortlessly maintained thanks to this lifestyle change.

My wife had terrible social anxiety and had been on power antidepressants and benzo's like Xanax that left her in a stupor/sleeping and did NOT help the problem. As you can see in my first wedding pic, she wasn't large (though she lost 20+) but ate this way to support my weight loss. Within a month, her anxiety was just gone.... and with it so were the meds. We get to eat out; go to movies and have a general good time in the grocery store now without the dash to go in and get what you need and back out. Guess what comes back for a few days when she cheats?

This diet fixed SO many other things for me (anxiety of my own, arthritis, seasonal allergies, constant indigestion, and other gut related grief) as well. Anyone can do this once they learn the secret, and they can stay skinny. All of my skinny friends that I grew up with are now larger than I am! And I now weigh what I did at age 11, at (almost) 41.  

We've gone from just meat and vegetables to smoked meats and keto pound cakes, cheese cakes, and cinnamon rolls.... with icing!  I'm glad I got the weight off before those discoveries just the same.  

Enough stalling already; here is the album. Please be nice; this is a hard share. https://imgur.com/gallery/0lPMS9V ",1

He did a keto diet combined with Crossfit.  Unfortunately, he doesn't have a pic from his heaviest because he avoided cameras, so the ""before"" pic is from when he was about 320.  The after picture and the pictures of him in the pink tutu below (he was doing a fundraiser for breast cancer), he is about 300 pounds.

[Here are the pictures](http://imgur.com/a/g18nt).

He now donates at least two nights a week to training others for free to help motivate them to get in shape.

Edit - Removed the estimated body fat percentage because I don't think I remembered that number right.

Edit 2 - His words of advice:

""I had to find what worked for me, which turned out to be a lot of hard work and no slacking. If there's one thing I'd really like to impart to anyone that's trying to get fit, it's this; There is always a good reason not to work out. A valid, legitimate reason not to make the time to train. Progress comes from working around those, and going to the gym anyway, saying 'no' to that piece of pizza, even though you're starving, going on a run, even though you're tired and you've got an ingrown toenail.""

Edit 3 - ""I think it should be mentioned that I only did keto to get to my goal body fat%. After that point, I went strict paleo.""

Edit 4 - Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!  It is my first. =)

Edit 5 - From him - ""I gained about 40-50 lbs of muscle total, lost almost 100 lbs of fat. The entire process took 3 or 4 years, although the bulk of the weightloss took a year.""",1

I even started IF without problem the past few weeks.  

[Progress pic](https://i.imgur.com/ufjtFDG.jpg).  

I'm a boring guy that don't need variety food-wise, so my food intake didn't vary too much.  

Breakfast was usually eggs & bacon OR slice of fat bread with a generous dose of crunchy peanut butter with bacon.  

Lunch is something very light, like a salad with tuna & 0 calories dressing.  

Snacks: beef jerkies ftw!  

Dinner: my wife tried all kinds of keto recipes found here and elsewhere (sooo good!)  

And sometimes fat bombs in the evening to make sure I was in ketosis.  

Haven't changed my training routine too much, aside from going to the public pool for swimming sessions 1-2 times a week during my lunch break.  

Lost some of my strength though (not good for my ego), so added protein shakes to my schedule to address this.  

Anyway, thank you all for your posts here. They are what motivated me to continue. It's really appreciated.

I wanted to share my story with you.

I've never cared to actively draw attention to myself, unfortunately, my absent father's genetics were far from absent in my pubescent years meaning I've grown to be a 6'4"" member of those social elites gifted with the ability to see dust on top of refrigerators.

Being this tall was already plenty to keep me from being able to fly under the radar of the many cruel youths that roam the halls of sleepy small town public school. Add on to my chandelier-forehead-smashing height the fact that I had size thirteen feet before I had even lived thirteen years. 

On top of that, puberty hit me like a truck, and by truck I mean like a dump truck full of hair. When kids were showing off their first arpit hairs I already had my shoulders filling in nicely.

So there you have a young adult sasquatch trying to avoid detection from the poachers wielding rifles loaded with insecurity and fear. What could possibly make hiding more difficult for that self-conscious teen monster? 

Fat Giant Hairy Kid. 

I've been overweight a lot of my life. When I was eleven I had the first of two surgeries that involved sawing each of my femurs in half and screwing them back together. Unlike my youthful expectations, this procedure was not to give me bionic legs with the ability to leap over buildings and win track meets to impress girls, in fact it temporarily turned my legs as useless as a hat underwater. I ended up quitting all my physical activities because I was embarrassed about falling behind. 

This was the start of a not-so-beautiful katamari tumbling and gaining momentum. The pounds came fast. I've been obese for most of the time that I've been actively making memories. 

When I started Keto as my New Years Resolution this year I honestly don't know what I expected, certainly not for it to work as well as it did. This has been both far simpler than I ever anticipated, while also being one of the most challenging and fulfilling things I've ever done. 

When I started [I was a big boy](https://imgur.com/2pSfzlg) consistently adjacent to that 300 pound mark. You can just see in the picture that at that point I was more beast than man. Eyes glossed over with that carby glaze. Shovelling bread into my mouth like it's going to smother the smoldering self-loathing that coats my insides. 

My mother took that picture of me, and I hated it. I hated every picture of me, I could never look at myself without cringing and seeing all the things that the other people saw. I've always had a huge mental barrier between myself and photogtaphs that pushed me to avoid any documentation that made real how physically different I look to what 
my brain feels inside. 

My mother took [a lot of pictures of me](https://imgur.com/tNEt0lx) on our trip to egypt at the end of 2016, I had read about Keto that summer and talked to my girlfriend about trying it, expecting this to be just another thing I talk about and consider but don't follow through on. [Those pictures though](https://imgur.com/6SaEEQQ), they just got to me. Here I had gone on this amazing trip across the world, and I didn't anyone to see any of the pictures. It just felt like a giant monument to how much I had let things get out of control. 

I started Keto January 1st 2017, hard. My girlfriend did most of the legwork when it came to recipes and shoping lists. I'm hugely grateful to her, and to all of you. for the support and motivation to just do the dang thing. 

I started at 302 lbs, 44 pant size, xxxl shirt. I'm currently 190ish, 33 pant size, large shirt, and honestly I stopped checking the scale. The mirror brings me more than enough joy now to keep me going.

I think the most unexpectedly huge change has been psychological. At long last, I like what I see when I see myself. I can finally genuinely look the way I want to when I buy new clothes. My mind is finally finding a synchronicity with my identity that's giving me confidence-gains such that I could swear I'm just intravenously connected to Dwayne the Rock Johnson's ego.

My mother [took another picture of me today] (https://imgur.com/QEKijKb) while she was visiting for Canadian Thanksgiving. It's finally really set in what I've accomplished. The fact that I can see a picture of myself without cringing fills me with so much glee that it's pouring out into this keyboard. 

I'm sorry, I've been rambling, I just really wanted to thank you guys for helping me, and share a bit of myself with you. Thanks to you, [I can finally renegotiate my relationship with cameras away from being one of fear and anxiety.](https://imgur.com/9xiI1Li)

And, of course, for those of you who actually value your time

Hey Reddit, my name is Cody and I'm a recovering binge eater.  

Around 10 years ago I had an extremely traumatic experience which completely tanked my self worth and made it difficult for me to experience happiness so I turned to food.  Instead of confronting my issues and moving forward with my life I just ate food constantly to keep grasp of what is once felt like to be ""human"".  My regular eating cycle during this time was the normal 3 meals plus snacks but I'd also (generally 4-5 times a week) order a couple pizzas, subway subs or donair and poutine and devour that as well on top of everything else I was eating. 

So it didn't take long for me to become morbidly obese and ruin many of the other aspects of my life.  It was tough financially because I spent so much money on food, I didn't want to be around other people so I push many friends away as well as put allot of stress on my family.  

All of this almost came to its conclusion back in December when I got [flesh eating disease](https://imgur.com/a/TSUmNVd) (images are slightly NSFW) and almost died.  My weight made the surgery very risky and I'm just lucky all I really lost was my belly button.  After being in the hospital for 10 days, I had to go in and out of the hospital 3 times a week for the next 4 and a half months while I grew everything back they took out from the debridement.  

Once I was fully healed the surgeon that did my surgery asked me on our last visit what we were going to do about my weight and if I wanted help.  I felt truely defeated about my weight but I knew I needed help so I told him yes.  Weeks later I get a letter from something called ""weight wise"" which is basically a program for people like me to prep and get ready for bariatric surgery.  This was a real wake up call for me because it made me really realize how hopeless I must have appeared to everyone.  This made me want better for myself and even if it wasn't for the weight wise programs 2 year waiting list I was determined to do something about this on my own.  

So I started keto.  I knew about it from past failed attempts at getting my eating and weight under control but I just don't think I was ready then.  I started off just by eating keto and walking more.  I did that for awhile and it wasn't long before I wasn't hungry in the morning so I just started to skip meals and it wasn't long after that I realized some days I only needed to eat once a day.  Additionally a couple months go by and I started working out 3 or 4 times a week which seemed to give me lots of energy and kept me from hitting a plateau until I of course did.   So once I started to notice the weight loss get stagnant I did more research into prolonged water fasting and decided to give that a day.  I started off by doing a couple days and eventually worked my way up to 3 and a half days without eating!  This was a very great experience for me because it helped me learn allot about my body and it made me feel good as well.   When my best friend went on vacation I decided to challenge myself and water fasted for an entire week in which I lost 15 pounds (gained back 7 within a week).  

So I'd say Keto saved me, its given me a second chance.  Its amazing how changing what I was eating not only has made me healthier but gave me control over my hunger.  I'm still messed up emotionally but this whole experience has given me the courage to reach out and get therapy for my other issues as well.   So while I still have lots of work to do I'm on the right path now. 

Thanks for listening!


Edit:  I wanted to thank you all so so much for all of the overwhelming support!  I sat here for the last couple hours replying to all of you completely teared up and filled with joy.  I promise to be back and update you all on some future milestones! 

I will try to reply to some more comments tomorrow but I'm getting ready to travel to Texas for a trip I was suppose to take in January before the flesh eating disease had different ideas.    

Take care everyone. ",1

[PICS](https://imgur.com/a/HuxSR)

Journey has been 4.5 years with the almighty keto. 
I lost 130lbs and recently had tummy tuck surgery to remove excess skin from my abdomen. This is my update. 
Here is link to original post [fuck Friday this can’t wait](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7g4he9/fuck_friday_this_cant_wait_today_is_the_day/?st=JC8BEF5E&sh=94a5e6ec) 

I have recovered with flying colors. 
Going for my 6 week final post op appt tomorrow. Feels great!!
I am so happy with my results!! My surgeon did an exceptional job. 
With keto, I finally gained control of my life and lost 130lbs. I’m so happy to be finally reaping the full benefits of my hard work and dedication. 
Many details a lot of people never even think about: For the very first time in my life I have a waist and hips!!! Also, I now have a lap. My twin niece&nephew were able to climb into my lap comfortably together on Christmas. I don’t have to worry about my stomach making weird skin slapping noises when I move or exercise. No more wearing deodorant under my belly.  
Warning!!! NSFW details: When reaching between my legs you feel fun bits instead of just belly. And...I feel cute in panties! A seemingly small detail of femininity I was never privy to which is really a huge challenge (now addition) to self-confidence. 

A literal and metaphorical weight was lifted off me. I feel like I have a second chance at being the healthy and happy person I’ve always wanted to be. 

Surgery details: My surgeon removed 10lbs of excess skin from abdomen. He did not need to tighten my abdominal muscles. And he did not do any liposuction. Both were “possibly needed” pre-surgery but deemed unnecessary once in. It was a 2 hour outpatient procedure.  I had 2 drains afterwards. One removed after 6 days, the other removed after 20 days. I had a novocaine pump in me for the first week.  

For those curious about the recovery:
I went to hell and came back. The pain was surprising honestly. I was under the impression I would feel most pain around the incisions. Boy was I wrong. Incisions are numb. Even still, lots of numbness along there as my nerves are reattaching themselves. The pain was the shocking feeling of tendons and fascia stretching, tugging, and pulling across my abdomen. After the initial surgery drugs wore off, I couldn’t stand up straight for almost 2 weeks. It was hell. At the time I said to everyone I wouldn’t recommend this surgery to anyone who does not need it drastically. It’s very painful and debilitating. You will not be able to work for at least 2 weeks. And after that it will be challenging and often painful for 2 more weeks or more. And that’s coming from a healthy 27 year old who healed fast. 
On the other side of recovery, im ECSTATIC with my results. My surgeon did an exceptional job!!!

Here is a before and during of my keto journey: https://www.instagram.com/p/BZO-xhfAe0o/


The girl on the left was 355lbs her senior year in high school.  The girl on the left spent her entire life being overweight, weighing in the 270s in middle school.  The girl on the left skipped laps during the mile in high school and lied about it when caught.  

The girl on the right discovered keto 2 years ago after re-gaining all of the weight she had lost from calorie counting.  The girl on the right has lost 122lbs since her highest weight, 101lbs of that since starting keto.  The girl on the right ran 6 miles in a little over an hour today.  The girl on the right cried because she realized she can defeat the thoughts holding her back from reaching her running goals.

The girl on the right signed up to run 10 damn miles in a race. 

Why you ask?

*All for the girl on the left.*

Don’t compare yourself to others.  See how far you’ve come, whether you’re just starting out by cutting soda and slowly cutting carbs, or whether you’ve reached your ultimate goal weight.  See what you’ve done, and use that to decide how far you want to go.

Hey Reddit, my name is Cody and I'm a recovering binge eater.

I just wanted to give a little update on how I'm doing.  I've come a long ways in the last couple months not just in weight loss but mentally as well.  In terms of the weight loss I've done fairly well through my commitment to keto, a couple fasts and increased exercise in the gym.  I've started to notice muscle slowly coming through in certain parts of my arms and shoulders which feels really nice.  

In terms of progress on my mental health I've made some simple, yet big feats which will hopefully help me grow over the next year.  I've really come to accept that I deserve to feel happy about myself, shouldn't feel like a monster inside and while I still need time to make those feelings fade I'm heading in the right direction.  So while my self worth will probably always be something I struggle with its definitely improving. 


In terms of overall health though I'm doing really good!  I went to see my Doc after about 6 months and **I'm no longer pre-diabetic**, my testosterone levels are up (though still way low) and my cholesterol is amazing despite eating bacon almost everyday (proof dietary cholesterol isn't what causes heart disease).


**My goals for next year though:** 

 - Get to 230 pounds

 - Go to school or improve career options

 - Find the courage to get into a relationship  

 - Learn to play the piano

 - Help others with their weight loss journey


Thank you all for being so supportive with my last post, it really meant so much to me!  I will be back once I hit 270, take care all!!",1
"[Pics] Update! Recovering Binge Eater, 130 Pounds gone, 1 Year. Keto/Fasting!",1529,byqwmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/byqwmm/pics_update_recovering_binge_eater_130_pounds/,95,1560153317.0,"[Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/tyzNLET), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BxBlOA0gA6s/),  And [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/aafelx/pics_update_recovering_binge_eater_100_pounds/)  (Sorry, I'm a month late posting all this)

Hey Reddit, my name is Cody and I'm a recovering binge eater.

It's been a year since I set out on my journey and oh boy has it been a journey.  I've come a long ways with my weight, emotionally (though with many bumps) and professionally.  I'm very fortunate for the progress I've made but I'd be lying if I said it was all easy.  

I'm still doing well in the gym working towards my goals but admittedly I've digressed emotionally in the last 3 months.  Things in my life were going exceptionally well, I was thriving but I've had some major set backs due to some really unfortunate drama.  

I won't go into too deep (mainly because I'm pretty sure someone involved knows my reddit) but I lost the closest people to me in my life and I've been completely devastated ever since.  It hurts so much because I worked so hard to better myself and I finally really opened up to someone, I took the risk to really get close to someone and now that person is gone out of my life.  And it's just really unfortunate because none of this needed to happen, I largely blame myself though because I handled everything so poorly when shit hit the fan but I know I didn't deserve what happened.  Looking back though the signs were there this wasn't going to workout long term, family's generally stick together and it was clear 1 of these friends wasn't okay with me having relationships with her family outside of her company. 

But I know it's probably for the best that it all ended though but I really don't know where to go from here.  I feel such an immense amount of emptiness in my life that I don't know how to fill.  I'm terrified of getting close to people and trying to make new friends because I just don't think I can get hurt like that ever again.


**But I will proudly say I never shut down** (I honestly almost did), I kept going and I've never lost sight of my goals. I realized if I shut down and give up all those horrible things that were said about me become real, I know if I give up all this hard work would have been for nothing.  


**So what about my goals for this year so far?**

 - Get to 230 pounds: So far I've lost 30 pounds this year and put on a bunch of muscle so I'd say I'm certainly on track!  I've been eating much more than I was before but I'm also pushing myself way more in the gym.  Currently I'm squatting for 100 days in a row so next update I will let you all know how that went!

 - Go to school or improve career options: I pushed for a promotion at work and got it.  I still wanna go to school one day but I'm okay with the promotion right now as it's helping me get stuff together in my life. 

 - Find the courage to get into a relationship:  Yeah this is the tough one.  As I mentioned above I'm terrified to get close to anybody because of all that's happened but might not be as far off as I often lead myself to believe.  I actually asked a girl out about a month, I've had a huge crush on her for years and she even said yes.  The difficult part is I was kind of just in a *mood* when I asked, I honestly didn't think she'd say yes and I've been terrified of her ever since so I never followed up :P   But it's really nice knowing that it's even a possibility. 


 - Learn to play the piano:  I started lessons in March, I'm often too emotional to practice so I wish my progress was more but [here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAXjQwKJKMA) of me playing my favorite song in the world (This is old, I can play better now but don't have a nice Piano at home to record a new video) (I'll donate 25CAD to a charity of choice to the first person to name the song). 
Edit* /u/tmwdysln got the song, [Comme des enfants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUI6Tvd1sA)


 - Help others with their weight loss journey:  I really wanted to do more here but I feel like I really need to get myself sorted out first.  I've tried making videos but I end up just crying and it turns into a mess.  But it's still something I really wanna do, I hope this post can help people out.  


So thank you all for the support over the last year, this sub has certainly helped me.  I go back very frequently and read the amazing comments you've all left me on the other posts.  My biggest piece of advice is no matter how hard things get, no matter how bad things feel please please just don't shut down. Keep pushing and working hard because I think we all know deep down that it will get better but it won't happen if you shut yourself down.",1

The struggle to get to 100 over the past few months was rough (vacation and then adding in exercise made the scale my number 1 enemy), but this morning, I woke up at 101.2 pounds down. I smiled, I looked at myself in the mirror and I'm so fucking proud.

This is proof that if you just stick to it, and don't ever give up, even when the scale is being a giant asshole, you will reach your goals. Seriously. Hard work pays off!

Oh also? One of my favorite things about waking up today and being down over 100 - my dinner last night was Five Guys bacon cheeseburger bowl. I'm not saying keto is easy, because at times, it's a challenge, but holy shit is that satisfying, haha.

I hope this inspires someone who is thinking about doing keto. I still have a long way to go, but I am living proof that you can do this. Even if you're over 400 pounds, you can fucking do this.

I’m hoping that sharing my story will help someone. If you’re sitting there wondering if you should give keto a shot, for the love of god, do it. I will NEVER go back to eating the way I did before—I’m keto forever now.

Because it changed my life! 

I used to weigh 210 pounds. I now weigh 125 and have maintained for a couple of years. (I’m 5'5"".)

The first time around—about fifteen years ago—I didn’t lose the weight with keto; it was more of a basic hate-yourself-and-eat-rice-cakes CICO diet. I got down to around 130, sure, but I felt pretty icky and tired a lot of the time. Then I gradually started eating more because I was always hungry, and my weight crept back up to around 160. But three years ago, I found keto because of Gary Taubes, and everything changed. 

(Imagine pictures of butterflies and rainbows here.) 

The benefits I’ve had ASIDE from the weight loss:

* I no longer get acne. Up until keto, I’d had it my whole adult life.
* I have the energy of the universe, even if I miss out on sleep. 
* Speaking of which, I sleep better.
* My teeth are cleaner.
* My periods are lighter and easier, and my hormones have evened out (no more spotting, whoo!).
* My hair doesn’t fall out like it did before.
* I WANT to exercise. Keto = magic. Keto + workouts = godlike powers.
* I don’t have a gallbladder. Keto FIXED my digestive issues. No more acid reflux!
* My resting heart rate went down by about 25 BPM (before I even added exercise to the mix).
* My anxiety and depression disappeared.
* Best of all, I fixed my relationship with food. Now, it’s fuel. Before, it was my lover when I was lonely, my comfort when I was sad. I don’t feel the need for that as often anymore.

…And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. I have to tell you that being thinner and fitter is SO MUCH BETTER. People are way nicer to me. Men stare at me for the first time in my life (I’m 41!). I feel like I can do anything. And all of this glowing health is what I owe to eating butter and beef tallow (OMG, *get you some* if you’ve never scrambled eggs or cooked chicken in it). 

[Comparison Pics](http://imgur.com/a/0e0zs)

Please, do it. Start today. Don’t let the first few weeks deter you if they’re hard. You have no IDEA what the endpoint feels like, trust me! Nothing on this earth tastes good enough to make me give up what I’ve gained in energy and mental clarity alone.

And you can do it too! If you're already doing it, KCKO!",1

[Progress Pics!](https://imgur.com/a/6zI6u)

(EDIT to add: I started keto in August 2015, I should have started with that!) I started doing 16/8 IF in March 2016, switched to OMAD this past August, then started adding in 48-hour fasts in November.  Now I regularly do 72-96 hour fasts and only eat 2-3 times per week because I only seem to lose weight while fasting anymore; I decided I'd rather have a few large meals than restrict my OMAD meal size any further.  I'm going to ride it out as long as the weight loss continues, but I know I don't want to do longer fasts than this, I did ONE 5-day fast and my body was REALLY unhappy afterwards.  While fasting, I drink Monster Ultra Zero, water, and some Diet Mountain Dew.  The Monster may halt autophagy but that isn't my main goal for fasting.

I'm happy to answer any questions.  I still use Reddit a lot for information but I've found a great keto community on Instagram and made some great friends there.  You can find me there at [cats.and.keto](https://www.instagram.com/cats.and.keto).  My account is food-focused.",1
[Pro Tip] You do not need CKD/TKD,0,t5lp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/t5lp7/pro_tip_you_do_not_need_ckdtkd/,30,1336103739.0,"I think I see a post more than once a week with someone considering CKD/TKD. Guys, you don't need it, *lemme 'esplain*.

Everyone raise you hands.

If you are a professional athlete (like at a collegiate level, or on a professional travel team, or competing on a state or national level) I mean you live for your sport *not play kickball on weekends for team Thundercankles*. Yes if you are one of those peoples leave your hand up, everyone else **put your hand the fuck down**.

Everyone with your hand up I suggest you go look up CKD/TDK and do it. All you other people with your hand down, congratulations you can stop worrying about whether or not you should do CKD/TKD, **because you shouldn't**.

CKD/TKD is only if you are working out at such an intense level that keto is hindering you from achieving your fitness goals. An athlete might notice a drop in physical performance when doing keto, and while it is possible to ""break through"" this slump eventually, it's much easier to load your body up with some glycogen to help push you through the slump and on to athletic greatness. 

**TL;DR Unless you are an athlete you do not need TKD/CKD or any sort of carb-up business.**",1

I'm absolutely head over heals for her, I've never felt such a connection to a kid, from day 1. Anyway, on Wednesdays her parents bring her over to spend the day at her grandparent's (my uncle and his wife). I went over there yesterday to visit them and spend some time with her. She's such a lovely child, adorable. I was there about 4 hours total. In this time, they fed her some boiled beans with tomato sauce, then some [sugarapple fruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar-apple). Then we were having a bite and she wanted to eat with us so they gave her some bread to munch on. After that, we sat and they fed her some persimmon. Before I left, they were making her an ice-cream cone. 

I was livid. I whispered to my mom, saying something like ""OH MY GOODNESS no wonder she's overweight! Why are they feeding her sugar all day? This is insane!!"", and she looked at me with sad eyes and said ""yeah, that's what she eats over *here*, it's healthier than what she eats at *home*"". 

The little girl is surviving on different forms of sugar! Don't kids need healthy fats at that age? And I have no idea if this is related, but she was late to walk, and she still hasn't talked other than babbling daddy and words like that (she's 1 year 5 months old). She's overweight and constantly asking for food....

Oh, and the kicker? **BOTH HER PARENTS ARE DOCTORS**. I mean wtf.

I couldn't help but try and say ""she seems to have had enough"" or ""hey don't persimmons have loads of sugar?"" or ""hey she eats lots of fruits huh"" but nothing. Nada. Her grandma never flinched, and she was the one feeding her everything, and if I try to say anything she pushes me away. Thing is, she's not my kid, I can't tell them how to feed her. But it's so *frustrating*, I mean it's not my opinion, it's science! 

Am I being unreasonable here? Do all parents feed their kids all-sugar diets? Am I becoming over-judgy because of keto? Honeslty, I don't like to admit it but I *am* becoming more judgmental :/

**EDIT**: A couple points:

 - Maybe I should have clarified, I see her at least once a week. All she eats is sugar, morning noon and night (although most are healthier than others, of course). I've never ever spent a day there without her being given ice-cream or cookies.. Sometimes both. My mom tells me what she eats at home, and it's a lot of fruits and even more processed things with a high-carb content. I just described that last visit because in my mind it's a window into her eating habits, but yeah I should have clarified.

 - I'm not judging in the parents, or how they're raising her. They're the best, and they really do the best they can. The post wasn't titled ""They're bad parents help!"". My point was, their information about nutrition so far seems to revolve around sugars being the main food in her diet, and my anxiety comes from the fact that I've come to learn how detrimental a high-sugar diet can be for health, and knowing that makes it hard for me to just ignore it. Also, I never even bring it up to them, **it's not my place as I said above. I was posting here to rant about how I *can't* say anything because she's not mine.**

Before you start arguing or down voting people who know what they're talking about, study biology and nutrition for a few years.  Read the ketoscience to the point where you have to take books out of the library to understand it.

I've seen a ton of posts lately that people are worried about not getting enough calories, and that's bullshit - you don't have to worry about that.  You can fast for a month and it's not generally going to harm you (particularly if you're overweight).

I'm not advocating extreme measures, but take a look at http://thoughtcatalog.com/dr-chet-williams/2014/06/this-450-pound-man-fasted-for-over-a-year-and-he-lost-more-than-half-his-weight/ - it can happen.

You also don't need a gram of protein per lb of body weight.  You might have better results from a little more protein on keto than otherwise, but common recommendations for general fitness are 0.8-1.2g or protein per KILOGRAM of LEAN BODY MASS, which is a huge difference.

If you're worried about losing muscle, the most important thing you can do is start resistance training; go lift heavy weights.  Then shoot for around 1g of protein per kilogram of lean body mass.  If you're hungry, add protein and fat to your diet.  If you're not hungry, don't even worry about it - make sure you're taking a multi vitamin, drinking plenty of water, and getting electrolytes.",1

It's very positive, it's a great community and it's a place we can all share and benefit from each other's knowledge and experiences... but I keep seeing a piece of advice that I just can't shake.

""If it fits your macros, it's fine"" and similar variants.

We're supposed to be encouraging a new, healthier relationship with food and I can't help but think that this sends out the wrong message. Whilst it's true that eating nothing but bricks of lard won't break your ketosis, this isn't any more of a healthy way of eating than vacuuming up Coca-Cola.

The human body requires a certain set of nutrients to operate at optimum levels: electrolytes, vitamins, essential fatty acids, protein profiles, etc. We should be aiming to encourage people to introduce these concerns into their WOE before they build a new bad habit.

A healthy diet includes some carbohydrates, not because the carbohydrates are necessary for energy, but because the nutrition density (amount of nutrition per calorie) of food items like spinach is so much higher than for non-plant food sources. If people 'spend' their carbs on crap like Atkins bars, they're going to become deficient in some nutrients.

Potassium is very hard to get right on a keto diet, we're supposed to be getting 4g a day but without adequate planning, we're not even going to get close. Magnesium is a similar, but less difficult, story. Then there are all the vitamins and minerals which are only present in meaningful amounts in vegetable sources.

I can understand telling new ketoers to just count carbs. It's a hard transition to make without bombarding them with information, but we'd do better to make people understand that whilst being in ketosis does wonders for fat loss, it's not a panacea for human requirements for nutrition.

The goal of the keto diet is to improve health. Weight loss is part of this for some people, but health is the primary goal. It frustrates me whenever I see thinly veiled compliments over eating harmfully low amounts of calories. Posts crop up here on occasion about how 'wonderful' keto is that it makes them feel full after eating 700 calories or whatever. I think we can all appreciate how ridiculous this sounds. Not only is this a stupid idea physiologically, but it reflects the vanity of caring about numbers on a scale and image rather than on actual health. This feels more like an eating disorder than a true attempt to become more healthy. If one were to be truly full to the point that they were 'unable' to eat more after such meager days of eating, it's probably more likely the dopamine rush of unhealthy weight loss which satiates them.",1

Imagine a terrible lifestyle in which you feel full all the time even though you can eat as much as you want. The torture! To be honest, I wouldn't want to wish such a terrible convenience on anyone. Not only did I get to eat as much as I want, but I could eat steaked wrapped in mozzarella and bacon until I popped. Life was good - I've never felt so good in my life. It was so annoying to be able to have an easy, good night sleep. The mental clarity was so frustrating. All this while making my body healthier? Disgusting. Then, I went to college.

I was told the email went to trash, and the if we want to remain as friends I should never bring this topic up, and that I practice pseudoscience! Ouch!

as a pseudo doctor in training (optometrist, ha) one of the things i've learned about the body is that the human body reacts differently for everyone.  i lurk on r/keto a lot and i keep reading all these 'i cant believe these nutritionists are telling me to eat bread' posts and in all honesty, that's what works for a lot of people.  eating a balanced diet including breads, controlling calories WILL let the average person lose weight.  I would imagine people that like would also prefer that because well...carbs are pretty delicious. In fact, doing something like keto is a fairly big gamble because CAD and atherosclerosis (both complications from too much cholesterol, fatty buildup) are no joking matter esp for overweight people (people that are more likely to adapt keto).  There are tons of research showing low fat diets works while keto research is pretty scarce (and in health, just because there is a little positive research about a subject doesn't mean it's correct). Yes, obviously keto works but there havn't been enough long-term studies with keto as a weight loss diet to show there aren't health problems. 

yeah idk, this is just a random rant. if someone calls you out for just eating meats and fats, isn't it enough just to explain that it's a diet you're doing and it's been working well for you? i don't think its necessary to look down on other people for not wanting to take a fairly significant risk. hopefully no one gets really offended by this post cause i do love this community but this is just something that's been irking me as of late. 

edit: alright guys, thanks for the great discussion.  unfortunately,  i got national boards coming up soon which i need to pass so i probably shouldn't be spending so much time on the internet.  ill read over a lot of the links people have posted with time.  i guess my closing argument is that its very possible that keto is healthy for you but until it can be really proven, i think its hard to strongly recommend it. for instance, theres always going to be people that will show you solid evidence that global warming isn't true but that simply isn't the case given the consensus of climate scientists.  to paraphrase a quote i read a while ago, if 9/10 oncologists say something causes cancer, you would believe them, so why would it be any different with nutritionalists/physicians? maybe they're all just outdated hacks but as someone who is likely to give actual medical advice to people, i just need more long-term studies backed up by the scientific community.  i dont mean to provoke, just giving some food for the thought. thanks for all the respectful comments.

-My joints have started to hurt a lot more. My unprofessional opinion is that keto has reduced inflammation in a lot of my body (I have a bad knee, and my discs slip easily in my spine) and it just FEELS like everything is in contact.

Some of us even had that friend or family member who would routinely (as if TRYING to screw us up) keep talking about the new sweet that they just tried and ""had to"" tell us about..... or seemingly just to taunt us they would post pictures of sugary poison. And we all remember thinking the ""I love you, but you're being a jackass"" thoughts.

[Rant] To Awaken the Bacon Mistaken,73,2zhn2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/2zhn2l/rant_to_awaken_the_bacon_mistaken/,141,1426729268.0,"It's been a while since I've been mercilessly downvoted for saying something rational, so don't disappoint me now, /r/keto; we been through too fuckin much together for you to start pulling punches.

I'm here to talk about bacon.  More specifically, I'm here to talk about the countless slobber-smeared posts on this subreddit glorifying and celebrating the unabashed consumption of insane amounts of bacon. I hope to awaken the bacon mistaken.

Look, I get it: some people have so much weight to lose that they can be at a caloric deficit and still eat a BLT sandwich with bacon-weave ""bread"" dipped in a mixture of bacon grease and blue cheese dressing. But is that the best idea? You can get your fats and proteins from a vast array of sources; is bacon the best way to go? More importantly, is that how we want to represent a diet that we insist is healthier than the villainous FDA's bullshit pyramid?

Eating that much of anything is detrimental. Variety of food is important with any diet for myriad reasons we don't have time for here. But variety becomes especially important on a diet that demands the profound restrictions demanded by the ketogenic diet (and don't tell me it's not restrictive; keto cuts out all fruits and grains which make up a gigantic portion of the food consumed daily across Planet Earth and you can certainly do this to great effect and be very healthy but that doesn't mean it's not restrictive).

I'm not saying not to eat bacon. I'm saying not to represent the ketogenic diet in such an irresponsible and unflattering manner. Can you eat bacon on a keto diet? Yes. Should you eat bacon? Absolutely. But posts like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/wxpcx/pics_m_44_59_240_to_178_because_bacon/), [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1t0pzk/pic_eat_all_the_bacon/), and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1mqkkh/pics_what_bacon_did_to_my_face/), which attribute (albeit in a slightly toungue-in-cheek way) all their weight loss to bacon, are misguided and misleading. 

You didn't lose weight because of bacon. You lost weight because you meticulously tracked everything you ate and made choices that meet your personal macro requirements. And congratulations! I am so happy for you and I want to do that too! But let's be more helpful to and well-reasoned when giving advice on how to lose weight.

Make no mistake about it: these posts where you show your wonderful, impressive, and inspiring progress are nothing if not advice on how to do it. The vast majority of people here are here because they desperately want to lose weight and nothing else has worked. When they see your progress, they take what you write seriously. Let's be better to those people.

I'd be remiss if I didn't take time for shouts out to posts like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/sjc3b/bacon_bacon_bacon_bacon_bacon_bacon_bacon/) and [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1gz4zp/can_we_stop_glamorizing_higher_numbers_of_strips/)—I'm standing on the shoulders of giants here and I hope I didn't let any of them down.

[Rant] Yes CICO is a thing. It matters on Keto. Let's stop being unscientific.,13,66h4pk,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/66h4pk/rant_yes_cico_is_a_thing_it_matters_on_keto_lets/,92,1492717245.0,"The past few weeks a number of posts have come up trying to equate Keto as being some form of metabolic magic that bypasses the laws of the human physiology. Among these posts are usually arguments that go like this - ""I ate X amount of calories in a high carb diet and didn't lose any weight. I now eat still eat X calories but am losing weight!""


I'm sure we all remember starting off on Keto. If you're anything like me, you struggled with diets and failed a lot of them. It *felt* like I was doing everything right and it sure *felt* like I should be losing weight but I wasn't. Then Keto comes along and the weight comes off. You feel great and instead of thinking that maybe you were just new to counting calories and screwing up somewhere along the process (which I know I did looking back) you think that maybe the medical community is in an echo chamber of bad dieting advice. You might think *""Keto is the best thing for people to lose weight, and by god, I'm pissed that I struggled this long when the answer was here all along.""*


But Keto is not magic. Keto is great and should be recommended as a starting diet over counting calories because it sets you up for success. Higher fat and protein content in food makes people more full for longer. Because blood sugar is regulated and not spiking/crashing, people feel less hungry and therefore eat less. This is all great stuff but in the end, all of this equates to people eating less calories. It's important to understand that **YES** people can be carb sensitive in that their blood sugar reacts in a more pronounced way to refined carbohydrates and will eat more because of it, but the carbs themselves are not nutritional hellspawn making these people fat.


Counting calories is one strategy that works for people who are stringent on tracking everything they eat, and weighing food portions. I, like many people here, can eat on Keto at a deficit naturally and don't have to do this. If someone who had success counting calories, or had any knowledge of human biology, were interested in Keto and came on this sub, it would be off-putting to see a group of people who deny the laws of thermodynamics and would rather believe that the medical community and nutritionists everywhere are wrong. I know it's exciting when you find a diet that works for you and you start losing weight. You probably pick up a Gary Taubes book and start reading about the effects of carbs and sugar then end up thinking they are the greatest plagues ever set upon humanity. I used to think this way, and I certainly did think CICO was just plain wrong until I spent enough time on this diet and read a lot more to understand, Keto and all diets come down to CICO. **Does Keto have metabolic advantages over other diets?** Definitely, I'm not denying that. More fat is burned on low-carb diets in general, but just because low-carb works doesn't mean other diets don't work. 


On Reddit, the first place a person would go and try to learn about dieting is probably r/fitness. As a community it would be better if they came here understanding ""yes, what you read is true. You need a caloric deficit to lose weight, and here is how Keto helps accomplish that."" Instead of ""No, CICO is wrong and Insulin/carbs will keep you fat regardless of caloric intake (paraphrasing but you get the point).""  This viewpoint ruins the credibility of a great diet that can help a lot of people. I certainly believe that most people would have a better quality of life on a low-carb diet. But in regards to weight-loss, I feel it's important that the advice given to people is not opposing the advice they're receiving elsewhere. End rant.",1

There is a night and day difference to my mood when I stay on keto though, which is why I'm continuing. I've maintained my weight at 125 pounds and have not seen any weightloss from being on keto for over a year [my total weightloss took 8 months], which is perfectly fine with me; it's just made such a difference to my mood that I'm trying damn hard to stay on it. It's overwhelming to try and manage the diet (because cooking), plus school, plus homework, plus free time, plus your everyday crap. Diet-wise, sometimes I'm just like, 'yay.. Another egg/bacon/cheese/ground beef/chicken/WHATEVER meal....... Ugh.' And then there were pretzels! It seriously doesn't take much to sway me nowadays.

[Rant] eliminating fat as much as possible,2,2eyez4,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/2eyez4/rant_eliminating_fat_as_much_as_possible/,27,1409377505.0,"Okay, straight up I haven't even known about this diet for years. I'm not an expert. I have a lot to learn, but I do know that keto is not a high protein, low fat, low carb diet. I have been wanting to post this for awhile, and didn't want to post it on photo friday, but I can't hold back anymore. (begin rant:)

Lately the trend being thrown around is to ignore the FAQ and 'Keto in A Nutshell' and follow this:

1. keep carbs under 20-30g
2. eat as much protein as you need
3. eat fat to satiety

The are at least two big issues with this. 

The first one is that after a month or so on this diet, you're not going to want to bother with step 3, because you're already full from protein. If I'm supposed to have 2000 cal per day, and I'm full from 1000, you're telling me to stop eating because the other 1000 are going to come from my fat cells. I'm sorry, I really wish it worked that way, but it doesn't, because it's not a simple equation like that. Your body is going to slow down drastically to keep you from starving, because it doesn't have a concept of how much it can keep drawing energy from itself. You can see this in obese people who keep eating more and more to stay satisfied despite how much excess is already stored. You will have much better success and you will feel better all around if you stick to the your normal energy intake requirements, as indicated by the helpful calculator.

The second one is that keto is not a high protein, low fat, low carb diet. It never has been and it never will be. There are very good reasons why the macro ratios were created by nutritional scientists for several several decades. If you'd like to take a spin on the diet, make it high protein, low fat, low carb, call it something else and make a new sub for it (or find one that already exists), then by all means go for it. You can't call it the ketogenic diet though because that one is already taken for a diet high in fat, moderate in protein, and low in carbs. The macros were made for this diet because that is what makes the diet work. It can't be explained in a sentence or a paragraph, or a thread or even a book. It's far more complicated than that. Keto works as is. Trust the system. If you are scared to eat any fat then do more research. Read more books like 'good calories bad calories'.

I think the original intention of the 3-step low fat idea was to counter the belief that you can eat 5 sticks of butter a day on top of everything else you're still eating and be super-keto. That's arguable too as we have seen but that's fine, but don't take it to the extreme (which I'm guilty of myself sometimes - sorry) and express it in a way where people see: 'oh i should limit fat as much as possible' - that is a huge disservice to the community by breaking the core foundation of the diet.

If you tell people, like we have always done here - especially those who have been here for years - to use the calculator and aim your diet towards what it says you should have - then guess what, they still won't be adding 5 sticks of butter. It still solves the original goal and stays true to what this diet is all about.

It's anecdotal, but personally my best performance has been achieved by doing just that (following the calculator, getting macros close, and not coming in too low or too high around the calorie goal). When I tried the 3-step method, I was constantly tired and oversleeping and stalling stalling stalling.

TL;DR keto is high fat, moderate protein, low carb. trust the system

Edit: I see now it was intended for people constantly going over their caloric goals. It needs disclaimers for people like me. Some of you provide disclaimers and I think that is great. You can still hate me and down vote all of my past posts. At the end of the day keto will still be a high fat diet and the standard american diet will still have sugar in just about everything.

Unless you have a major thyroid disorder and don't move at all, then yeah *maybe* it's possible. 

There are benefits of ketosis other than fat loss, which I understand. But bashing low calorie diets isn't the way to do it, they both work. We must understand the importance of calories, and eating more ""fat"" won't make you burn more fat either. If you any of you guys have a MFP account, see your caloric intake, I bet it's under 2,000 calories almost every time, and from experience on my list, most people eat 1200 calories and brag how much they eat. 

There, keto is merely a trick to eating less, it's not magic but it is something special that improves people's lives, lets just not be ignorant about other lifestyles. I'm on a semi low calorie diet (1800 calories) and I'm consuming 100-300g of carbs so I can maintain intensity while lifting weights, and guess what, I'm not [gaining all the weight](http://i.imgur.com/ipfCbFo.jpg) back and I'm getting [somewhat shredded](http://i.imgur.com/zsK8DZr.jpg). 

Hope this helps stop this bashing of carbohydrates, they're not as evil as you think. But keto has made me lost a lot of fat and I thank the science behind that.

**2nd edit**: Sorry everyone who came here for pics, but this post blew up on imgur and the other subreddit and I've had lots of attention. I'm deleting all my progress pics from the forum but I will copy paste my story from Imgur here below:

I started at around 97-99kg (213-218lbs) depending on if you count the day I went low carb or the day I went keto as my start date, which at 5'2"" (1.57m) is Category III Obese (BMI > 40). This was Dec 2016 / Jan 2017. 

In March 2017 I was officially a BMI of 35 (Class II obese) at around 86kg (190lbs)! The first ten odd kilos disappeared as though through a wave of a magic wand, which was really, really heartening for the little obese girl who had been fat ever since I could remember. 

72.8kg (160lbs) took me until October 2017 to reach. That was under BMI 30, and this was the first instance to reduce me to literal tears. I never, ever thought I would get here, and I never, ever, EVER thought I would blow past this point. Soon after this my weight loss stalled HARD, and I took a break from losing for over a year to deal with things that cropped up in my personal life. I vowed I would come back and make a post when I hit 61.6kg (~136lbs), if I ever did. I never expected to hit that weight, because I weighed more than that even as a 12 or 13 year old. 

Guess what, bitches? I did it. 61.5kg / 135lbs, a full three and a half years after I started this journey, but hey, better late than never. A full 35kg down from that very first rock bottom.

Conclusion: ""For the first time a feasible cause of human combustion has been experimentally demonstrated. So does this mean that victims of ketosis are likely to spontaneously combust?  Hardly – there are only about 120 cases on record throughout history, so it is vanishingly rare. On the other hand, there would be an argument against people with ketosis wearing synthetic fibres on dry days, and a new argument to give up smoking.""

I haven't really found any evidence in favor of this position.

We can study the literature of traditional diets, but you won't find a single ethnic group that has been documented to enter a state of ketosis. When we look at the Inuit, an ethnic group that has a diet almost completely devoid of plants, we still find no evidence of ketosis.

The Inuit generally eat their meat raw, almost immediately after hunting. This allows them to obtain carbohydrates from their meat, in the form of glycogen. They also eat body parts that you won't find in your local supermarket: Blubber, skin, organs, all of them high in carbohydrates.

Finally, like other ethnic groups dependent on high amounts of meat in their diet, the Inuit ferment their meat. They preserve carcasses under a skin of an animal, which causes fermentation, which leads the proteins of the animal to be converted into carbohydrates. Altogether, scientists claim that the Inuit are well above the level at which their body would enter a state of ketosis.

Americans are able to enter ketosis, because of a unique situation. Your supermarket provides you with meat and other food products high in fat. If traditional people eat meat, the animal has lived outside and ended up with much lower fat reserves. Thus, people with traditional diets high in animal products would have far more protein and less fat in their diet than modern people eating the same diet.

When you eat too much protein, which is a genuine risk for people living in Northern latitudes, you start suffering protein poisoning. This is one reason why traditional people like to ferment their meat, which converts protein into carbohydrates. Hákarl is an example from Iceland, of shark meat that is buried and allowed to ferment.

The Inuit have a diet where 50% of calories come from fat, 30-35% from protein, and 15-20% of calories come from carbohydrates. I'm not defending emulating the Inuit diet here. The Inuit have been found to have [genetic adaptations](http://www.amren.com/news/2014/10/gene-that-once-aided-survival-in-the-arctic-found-to-have-negative-impact-on-health-today/) to their ancestral diet, that Europeans don't have. Even despite their adaptations, they suffered detrimental health effects of their diet. Even if we wanted to emulate the Inuit diet, we probably can't. The ocean doens't have enough fish and mammals to eat the high omega 3 fat diet that the Inuit eat, which is an important factor in the relative lack of negative health effects from their diet.

With a genuine ketogenic diet, you're replacing most of the protein and carbohydrates with even more fat, leading to apparently [75% of calories from fat, 20-25% from protein, and 5-10% from carbohydrate](http://www.mydreamshape.com/keto-calculator/). This doesn't seem like anything near a typical natural diet. 

My question thus is as following:

-Do you believe that the Keto diet is unnatural, yet nonetheless healthy?

-Do you believe that I have overlooked something which leads you to believe that ketosis used to be quite common in our ancestors?

[UPDATE] 1 month of Keto | My Story till now,14,j76vyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/j76vyh/update_1_month_of_keto_my_story_till_now/,7,1602161224.0,"I had made [**this**](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/it6dzu/week_1_of_keto_and_if_making_myself_accountable/) post indicating the start of my keto journey, about 1 month back.

Here are some updates:

1. I have lost 10.4 lbs in 1 month. I am happy with the weight loss. Due to lots of work, some laziness and exhausting menstrual cycles, I have not been able to supplement or catalyse my weight loss with some form of exercise. That is on me. However, I have not cheated even once on my diet and I am really happy to report this!
2. Now coming to some non scale victories.... I was diagnosed with PCOD and had very irregular cycles. I was on contraceptive pills since 8 years to regulate my cycle. That in itself led to a lot of weight gain. I stopped taking the pills in August and started vitamin and nutrient supplements to counter PCOD, as per advice from my gynaecologist. I am SO happy to report that I got regular monthly cycles in the past two months! In fact, I got the current one 7 days earlier but my nutritionist said that is perfectly normal. Our bodies kind of ""resets"" itself once we go  on LCHF diets and this is just a way in which my reset is manifesting. 

Next steps:

1. i have found an excellent support group which is super regular and encouraging towards its members. shoutout to the group members for being very accommodating about the million questions I have had, and will continue having. 
2. I will try keto with OMAD as soon as my current menstrual cycle ends. Which is some time this Friday. 
3. I will DEFINITELY start with some form of exercise. I have thought about it: I will walk for 25-30 minutes per day. And I will do some minor functional training exercises at home like squats, crunches etc.

I just hope to continue my determination and drive. Because honestly, fizzling out is not an option anymore. I need to do this for my health.",1
"[UPDATE] Ending Keto after a one month trial - (How to end?, What I accomplished, Where I'm going)",0,uaip8,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/uaip8/update_ending_keto_after_a_one_month_trial_how_to/,3,1338337880.0,"Hey guys! Thanks for all the help, advice and support for my one month keto experiment. I’m going to provide a write-up of my ending keto, my results and where I’m going from here.   

Before I begin: Yes, I’m ending keto. I know that for many people here keto is more than a diet, it’s a lifestyle. However, I’m in a diet-hacking mood and really exploring my endocrinology and how I react to these diets.  

**Part 1: Ending Keto**: There is surprisingly little information on ending Keto. I had built it up in my head to be a big deal. I’d read anecdotes of people eating carbs and experiencing significant pain, dehydration and other ill effects of a rush of insulin. Despite that, I couldn’t find much info on how to end keto and switch back! Here’s my quick summary of what I did, if you're curious:   

(Note: I consumed a LOT of water all throughout: fight dehydration with hydration!)  

>**Saturday:** I ate keto in the morning, and for dinner we went to a great local barbecue place. I ordered meats with a carolina sauce (very low carb) and their spicy/texas sauce, which definitely had some carb (probably sugar) in it. I also had their coleslaw, which could not have been carbless. Saturday night ketostix: purple (ketones).    

*- Side effect:* I felt short-lived pangs in my stomach after consuming this. I ate the food in two sittings roughly half an hour apart, and both times left me feeling hot and in a little pain. The pain passed quickly, maybe 5 minutes at most.  


>**Sunday:** Morning ketostix was purple. I ate keto for the day except for dinner. I had chicken tenders (breaded, like 5 big ones) and ketchup, and I figured this would kick it but evening ketostix said positive still.  
      
*- Side Effect*: Felt hot after eating the carbs, no pain or side effects.  

>**Monday**: Determined to end ketosis, I ate a nice big portion of hashbrowns with my breakfast, and for dinner I went to Wendy's and had three spicy chicken wraps and their chili cheese fries. All this potato, sugar and tortilla! And yet, Monday night, ketostix still said positive.  

*-Side Effect:* Still getting the thermal response after eating carbs, maybe this is just normal and I don’t remember it! No other side effect.  

I haven’t tested today (Tuesday), and I don’t know if the ketostix are finding residual amounts of ketones or if I’m still generating them in excess. I’ll test tonight and update if people are curious.  


**Part 2: My Progress on Keto**   
Now I only did keto for one month so I wasn’t expecting anything dramatic. When I began last month I weighed 171lbs. I won’t call myself untrained, but I only have as much muscle as 4-5 months of starting strength offers.  I’m 5’9”, as well. I don’t have a bodyfat estimate for prior.  

I set my calorie goal in the beginning week, but weeks 2-4 I did not obey a calorie goal. Instead I found it easier to follow macros: specifically, no direct carbs (sugar/wheat/rice/etc) and <25g carbs per day. I began allowing foods that had 1-2g sugar per serving, if the serving was sufficiently large (1g sugar / 20g of food = 5% carb ratio). Never affected my ketostix readings, which were always positive.  

At the end of the month, I weighed in at 156lbs. 171-156 = That’s a loss of 15 lbs in a single month! I was very impressed with such fast progress, and wondered how much was fat and how much was lean/water.  

My best guess at my bodyfat percentage is now 22%. I base that on weekly image threads as well as a self-administered 4 pt caliper test. What was my bodyfat starting? I unfortunately don’t know, but my best estimate at this point is that I lost 2-4% bodyfat.   

NSV - My clothes fit better (and two pairs of pants I couldn’t wear, I now can!). Some polo's I owned in 'preppier' styles were tight and looked bad, but now have loosened up a good bit. Also, on most pairs of pants my slight 'muffin-top' has all but disappeared, probably 1% more and I can call it vanquished! Still have love handles but I'm still 22%! Gotta get lower! Beast mode!

**What’s Next (Why I’m Not Continuing)**  
Keto was great. I learned a ton about my body and I learned how to respond to the question “what do you want to eat”. I always used to answer (in some fashion) “whatever sounds good/tasty”. Now I am better at saying “whatever fits my macros”. It’s a huge shift towards actively controlling what goes in.  

Next up: Leangains IF on a body/recomp (+20%/-20%) diet. I want to get back to the gym, back to the barbells and back to the compound lifts. I need carbohydrate to do it. I thought about CKD for a while but ultimately I want a more simple diet plan that was built around lifting. Leangains is difficult to setup but easy to follow, and I'm excited to transfer what I've learned under keto to be successful at Leangains. (No trouble on high protein/fat low carb rest days here!)  

**Pictures**  
If anyone wants to see measily -15lbs/1mo photos, I can nab them when I get home tonight. It’s noticeable, but subtle. It’s only one month!  

Thanks guys, and good luck!  ",1

"[Update] My relationship with keto ends here, but it is definitely the good kind of goodbye.",0,28z2rr,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/28z2rr/update_my_relationship_with_keto_ends_here_but_it/,2,1403653986.0,"Fellow ketoers. It has been great doing keto and reading the info / rants / updates here on /r/keto but i think my journey of keto-ing has come to an end. But I will stay on a low-carb diet simply because being on keto has its ups and down. Let me share you my experience of almost 2 months on keto. I started keto because it was an interesting way of dieting, other than the fruits & vege diet which by now is the most mainstream way of dieting and FAT is bad. Honestly, i had that in mind... So i have been avoiding butter, a good amount of oils, heavy cream, cheese... you name it. My starting weight was 59kg and I wanted to go below that, like 57 kg and lose more body fat %, that was one of the reasons why i considered Keto. I have heard about other diets.... but none of them caught my attention like Keto did. 

Before keto, my diet used to be veges, fruits, almonds, the good carbs (barley, oatmeal etc.) & soy protein. I have been off sugar, pasta and the whites since December last year. So getting rid of the sugar cravings was not really my concern. However, I do noticed that I tend to munch on a damn lot of raisins & almonds when I'm highly stressed out. I work in an Oil & Gas industry and yes, it could be very stressful at times. I could eat like 500 kcals of raisins & almonds and my concern is that, i didn't feel full. By right, a person should at least feel somewhat satisfied having a half cup of almonds & raisins. But not for me... And eating raw carrots are the worst for me. Instead of becoming full and satiated, I just got hungrier. 

My weight maintained the same, but I definitely didn't feel good having to eat every 2 damn hours because like i said earlier, i am an emotional eater and yes, when i feel depressed I do tend to eat too. Although i didn't reach for chips or cookies... but too much of healthy foods can be bad for you too. Especially when your emotions are involved. I might have a slight borderline personality disorder (BPD which i analyzed myself from the way i react to things & my surroundings). And i have been following Zuzka Light's blog as well and she mentioned about keto and its therapeutic benefits for the emotional eaters, so thanks to her, i was interested. 

My workout routine is 5 days a week, mostly body weight and running on the treadmill. Whenever i feel the urge to eat (although i just had lunch like 2 hours ago), I would stop myself from reaching that raisins i stashed away in my drawer and wait til it's time for me to leave the office and off i go to the gym. Yes, working out does help to reduce the insulin level, keeping hunger at bay. 

But you know what is best, Keto diet. This was when Keto caught my heart back in May. I noticed that once I started the keto diet, I only ate two good meals a day and boy was i happy. But my workout routine suffered... I got tired after 20 mins of my workout, which normally i can go on for a good 2 hours in the gym. 

And this is when i found out about /r/ketogains where /u/darthluiggi talks about TKD & CKD. I had hopes!! I tried TKD since I don't wanna go through the hell of keto flu again. It didn't really help much but maybe because I was not quite in ketosis (my country somewhat lacks of this thing ketostix and the likes) and I still suffer in my workout routine. However, though I didn't maintain with the TKD protocol, but I had 1 tsp of honey (17 g carb) with my coffee, plus BCAA, L-Carnitine & 0.5 tsp Creatine which is more or less similar to the TKD protocol, damn i felt good. I did 60 minutes of tempo run on Sunday (yes, i am getting ready for a marathon in August & no, i don't do carbo-loading or whatever the fellow marathoners call it... I just like running). I had a good run, til Monday came. Monday. I don't know whether i had the Monday blues but damn, my body felt weak even after a good night's sleep.... and I was just not in the mood to do my work. Then a thought came to mind, yes perhaps it is time for me to have some good carbs in my diet again as i am looking into cutting as well. 

The best diet is to continue on whichever works best for you. Throughout this diet, I never cheated (though there are moments i wish i can have that piece of apple and bananas), and i followed all the dos & dont's of keto in order to maintain ketosis. MCT oil, bullet proof coffee, recipes from Ketodietapp (Martina is the best!!) and lots of research on what is actually ketogenic diet all about (yes please read Peter Attia's blog, Joseph Artica's site and definitely Lyle McDonald's book besides this AWESOME reddit site). Honestly, being in keto gives me a good steady energy but not for athletic performance, it keeps my insulin level low which i really love as i don't have the urge to eat whenever a stress comes up!! i just simply push it out with water and say hey, ketones inside! Eating fiber supplement really does help with the poop issues but once you're in ketosis, your body will at least go once a day.. please don't expect the amount to be the same before you were on keto because being in a keto diet simply means you're eating good nutritional foods which your body needs. 

I have gained actually 1kg, so currently i weight 60kg, but every other post in keto stated otherwise where ketoers lose massive amounts and i felt a bit disheartened because not only i stalled after a month but i gained as well, which is also partly the reason why i would like to stop with this diet. I am still experimenting so do not condemn me if I have stopped my keto relationship. I am increasing my protein intake, still low carb but moderate fat. Yes, please try your best to not eat fruits... but like i said again, once you're in ketosis, you'll pass the fruits and take a piece of bacon instead. One thing i did noticed and is very happy about is that, i have became leaner which proves that the f*cking scale is a lie! I have reduced about 1/2 an inch from my waistline and thigh... but the damn scale shows a gain (so currently i have kept it in a dark, dark place so as to teach it a good lesson not to confuse people) My mistake is that, i weight myself everyday, TWICE a day.. yes i am also obsessed with weight and have been through an eating disorder episode where my period stopped and all my bones were poking out...

Lost 10lbs of water the first week, 10-12 lbs over the next month, and kept it off until Thanksgiving. I went from around 215 to 186.

Thats when i gave in and carbs and sugar started creeping back in. I went from 186 back up to 199.6 as of today. 

Ive been trying to get back on the bandwagon, and i HAVE been eating lower-carb, but not keto.  Ive been drinking coke zero and eating sugar free jello, eating way less bread and using 4g carb pitas for mini pizzas. Overall healthier than i was before keto.

Ive also started lifting weights (shout out to SL5x5 and /r/ketogains) and im in much better shape than i was previously.. i still get compliments from coworkers about how much weight ive lost and how good i look. (Yay!)

But a warning to you newbies, those trying keto for the first time: you will fall off the wagon. Don't make the same mistake i did, get back up and get right back to it asap. 

As for me? Ive just perfected a keto vanilla machiatto that will be my breakfast, and my lunches for the last week have been 4 slices of boars head bacon and 3 scrambled eggs with cheese. Im gonna do my best to stick with it, and i plan to get back to writing a menu of every lunch and dinner for the week every saturday. That really helped, knowing what i needed to buy and thaw and prep.

So dont give up, even if you fall! Keep at it, toss some iron around, and KCKO.",1
[Update] on my doctors visit after my horrible blood test.,0,9e453r,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9e453r/update_on_my_doctors_visit_after_my_horrible/,43,1536440228.0,"[Origina Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9cvznl/i_finally_got_my_first_bloodiest_beck_while_on/)

Basically my doctor was floored.  He couldn't even believe that it was my blood and joked that I used somebody else's.

I have a great relationship with my doctor and even on a friendship level.  Basically he told me that he has never seen someones cholesterol that high before and that I was on the fast track for a stroke or heart attack. Also, that he is technically mandated to treat me.  I declined, assuring him I can get it back to normal in a month.  I have another blood test in one month and if it is not better, he needs to treat me. 

For those that don't want to read my previous post, I physically look like the epitome of fit and in good shape healthy.  I have never been over weight and do keto once a year or so, for a few months to lose some holiday fat.  I have never had a physical while on Keto until last week.  It was not good.  

* Total cholesterol=**398**
* Triglycerides=**84** 
* LDL=**290** 
* HDL=**88**

He also shocked me by basically reversing everything that I had thought or read about keto.  
He said it would increase my chances of getting Alzheimers (something that I lost my mother to 2 years ago)

I'm not gonna lie, im kind of pissed I never checked my blood on keto before.  I don't know how much irreversible plaque damage I might have done.  I just had a baby 2 years ago, and I can't be messing around.  I think that was it for me and keto.  Has anyone had similar results?  I will also post my new results in a month.",1
[WTF]4 Foods to Pack in Your Kid's Lunchbox-thanks for the obesity epidemic Yahoo!!! xoxo,0,y1q6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/y1q6c/wtf4_foods_to_pack_in_your_kids_lunchboxthanks/,11,1344722409.0,"http://shine.yahoo.com/healthy-living/4-foods-pack-kid-8217-lunchbox-141600455.html

I'll admit. I clicked expecting the worst. I even thought they'd list HotPockets, which to their credit, they did not. 
But let's parse this out, shall we? 

1) Oatmeal. And if you can't do that, whole wheat bagel. O.k. Of course, a whole wheat bagel is about equivalent to 2 TBSP of sugar, or more than a Snickers bar, but hey. Oatmeal has fiber and I would never call it junk food. It does make a kid hungry again after only less than 2 hours, but, you know. Tough luck. 

2) Beans: Alright. This is not insane. Beans make a lot of people's bodies happy, once you get past the stink on the other end. Lots of starch to turn into sugar, but it's a 'slow-food', so it's not bad. Wait. wha?

3) Chocolate milk: With said bean lunch. Yes. Because nothing says I love you other than **slamming** your kid's body with sugar water on top of starch on top of probably a sandwich only a few hours after spiking their insulin during their morning starch. 

O.k. I have Keto Hive Mind. I can accept that I may be reading too much into this. Breathe. Breathe. Allow my already low blood-pressure from my smart keto diet to reduce again and move on to read #4:

4) Watermelon. **WHAT?????** *Why?!!* Oooooooooh. So the kid gets water. Un-huh. I see....

I dunno. How about we give some **&^ing water instead? 
And where do they get 'mood stays stable' when giving a kid watermelon? These people obviously either don't have kids or are far down Sugarland they don't realize how unnaturally hyped their kids are.

And here you have it, folks. How metabolic disorder begins at earlier and earlier ages. ",1

I could fit in booths but my big fat belly and chest would be pressed up against the table and it would be uncomfortable. 

This time I slid right in and had about 8 inches to a foot of extra space between my belly and the table. I finally felt what it was like to feel like a normal person at a restaurant. It felt so fucking good. I was astonished, I was meeting for lunch with my mother and she couldn't stop her excitement. 

Ya know, sometimes since I'm so big I don't notice the physical changes my body has gone through. But goddam did I notice that. I have lost so many inches it's crazy. Dropped pants sizes and shirt sizes but nothing has felt as good as the getting seated at a booth of a restaurant anxiety relief.

I have a good sense with what I'm doing.  I can handle car road trips really well.

But I've been away at a conference for the week and I""m starving.  It's so hard to eat responsibility, in terms of unprocessed foods let alone getting to Keto friendly foods.

My flight this morning was at 5:30 am, I ended up with a yogurt from Starbucks, just to have something, nothing else was open, and when you taxi dependent you can't just stop and explore.

With airport security, it's really hard to take stuff through, and refrigeration on long travel days is impossible.

So I'm at Pearson in Toronto, landed at 10 am, my shuttle home doesn't leave until 1:30.

I got an apple pecan chicken salad from Wendy's and ate only the chicken, second ingredient on the dressing was SUGAR, and there were cranrasins and apples all over the place.

I'm not very good at advocating for the 'weird - hamburger, no bun' when there are big line ups.  Really self concious.

So this is my rant, my complaint.  I've been away from home for 6 days, I wanna go HOME!  Where I have fat bombs, and eggs on demand, a freezer full of steak!

And just to take the edge off, here is an album of the menus from the conference that had me shaking my head...eggs...contains eggs!

I completely eliminated junk in my house and haven't gone out to eat other than bunless burgers a few times. I spent hundreds on keto appropriate food and snacks, spent hours upon hours researching recipes and so much time making my food. I've resisted all temptations and turned down offers to dinner outings due to the places not having anything safe for me to eat. I've changed my mindset about food, and really only want it when I'm hungry for energy. I don't snack mindlessly. I drink nothing but water, and lots of water.



I'm 25, female, 5'4 and 230lbs. I currently eat around 1450 calories, 100-110g of fat, 70-90g of protein a day. At first I was eating what the macro calculator told me, 1540 calories, I lowered them a bit in hopes of a change, and there wasn't.  A typical day for me includes...


breakfast


2 eggs, 2 pieces of turkey sausage


lunch


tuna mixed with a little bit of mustard and mayo, with pickle, on lettuce wraps, with pork rinds


snack


a jack-links beef steak


dinner


steak, chicken or pork - grilled, baked or pan seared



cauliflower sides, rotation of veggies: asparagus, green beans, broccoli, yellow squash. 



I switched to low-sugar ketchup and eliminated BBQ sauce / A1/ etc. Dinner typically includes the most of my calories. I am often under 20g of carbs a day. 



I've lost one pound. That comes back and goes away all the time. I've lost no inches, not even in weird places like my wrist and ankles. I track everything. I weigh everything. I haven't experienced keto flu because I went into this prepared about my electrolytes. But I still don't have much energy at all, and I haven't had a solid poop in a month. The last time I lost a significant amount of weight (60lbs), I went from 250 to 190 by counting calories alone. I hit a plateau and nothing I did would break it, and I stayed the same weight for 6+ months before I started gaining again because not seeing any progress despite your efforts is really discouraging and I slowly stopped caring.



I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm okay making sacrifices if there is a benefit,  but I'm not seeing it. I'm tired of cooking all of my meals from scratch because I can't find anything without special ordering that's ""fast"". Want soup? I'd used to just open a low-calorie soup and eat it. Now I spent 30 minutes to an hour making one from scratch. A side for dinner used to be a pack of rice where I'd have 1/2 a cup of it, now I spend 30 extra minutes preparing cauliflower. I'm losing my willpower to keep doing this. I am sure it would be different had I saw something worth it by now.

It also stipulated you can eat ""one cup of steamed non-starchy veg with a teaspoon of vegetable oil"" which is pretty much the saddest thing I've ever read.

I make **homemade coconut milk**; not the cream, or a thick one you use to cook, but rather the milk you can drink alone or put it in your coffee (like, *1 cup shredded coconut/2 cups of water* recipe).

don't get pissed,0,qzan6,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/qzan6/dont_get_pissed/,66,1331930384.0,"I’m being sincere here.  I want to know what you all think.  I do believe that ketogenic diets are effective, but probably for different reasons than most people on this sub.  

I think a primary reason it is effective is people are tricked into a lower calorie diet.  For the most part, carbohydrate-laden foods are fairly calorically dense and of relatively low nutrition.  Not to mention the satiety factor.  I think by eliminating them from one’s diet, a person on a “normal american diet” can eliminate about 1000 calories from their intake without even thinking about it.  A few hundred from the bagel for breakfast, a few hundred from the bread in the sandwich for lunch, a few hundred from the soda and juice, a few hundred from the pasta with dinner, and so on…

Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s great that people are taking charge and improving themselves.  It rules.  I grab recipes from this sub regularly because I would eat about 80% keto without even trying; meat veggies and eggs are it for me.  But my point is that I can’t possibly fathom the ‘magical’ properties this diet is thought to have.  

I’m not really sure if I’m making sense, this week has been a gauntlet and my brain is fried.  But I guess what I’m getting at is this… Imagine one person eats 300 cals of oats/fresh fruit for breakfast.  Now imagine another person eats 300 cals of eggs/bacon for breakfast.  Now imagine all other things are constant including their diets for the remainder of the days.  I can’t possibly see one person losing more weight than the other in the long run.

Maybe I’m wrong.  Shit, hopefully I’m wrong and I’ll reap the benefits of it. I just can’t see it like that.  Thoughts?

eggs that will caress your soul with a mother’s warmth,610,ja5uy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/ja5uy2/eggs_that_will_caress_your_soul_with_a_mothers/,99,1602589232.0,"This recipe will contain graphic amounts of mozzarella cheese and fatty deliciousness, and is intended for a mature audience. Viewer discretion is advised. 

• the all time BEST 10-minute midnight keto snack •

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 whole eggs (or egg whites if you prefer)
- 1 cup shredded low moisture part skim mozzarella cheese
- a glob of butter roughly the size of a golf ball
- (optional) ground bacon bits

MATERIALS:

- frying pan (roughly 10” diameter)
- small bowl
- fork
- large cup / bowl (will be used to contain your excessive drool)

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Preheat your stovetop to med-high heat. Give your frying pan a kiss for encouragement, and place it down. 

2. Whisk eggs with mozzarella cheese in your bowl. Yes I know that’s a lot of cheese. It will look like just a bunch of cheese covered in egg. That’s normal. I promise. 

3. Gently slide the butter onto the pan and take a moment to enjoy the succulent sizzle of melting butter. Lift the pan and swirl it around like a chef in Hell’s Kitchen in order to spread the butter. 

4. Pour the egg-soaked cheese into the pan, giving it a little shake to spread it evenly. If you chose to use bacon bits, sprinkle them delicately over the eggs while whispering sweet nothings to them. 

5. After roughly 2 minutes, flip the egg onto itself to make a half circle shape. The bottom of the egg should be a golden brown color, like the teddy bear you grew up with as a child. 

6. Give the egg a gentle pat with the bottom of your spatula, or a firm one if you’re feeling cheeky. After another minute or so, turn off the stove and move the pan away, then flip the egg onto its other side for another minute. 

7. Slide the eggs onto a plate, and take a moment to bask in their glory. Perhaps snap a picture of them, so you can remember them later when you miss them. Top with more shredded cheese, because you know you haven’t reached your limit yet, and dig in. 

Please do not attempt this recipe if you are recently single and prone to falling in love.

Losing weight isn't ""easy"" to people who don't understand nutrition or how to effectively exercise. You could easily go on the internet to learn sh*t, get the wrong info and become discouraged.

Plus, a lot of unhealthy people just happen to be poor. So, even if they did exercise, they may only be able to afford the worst kinds of foods. 

 the worst kinds of foods are designed to be addictive.

you can be an extremely lonely person with no friends, no life, nothing to look forward to , and when you eat that pizza or fries, you are happy for a slight moment, its not just a physical addiction but an emotional one, and a lot of people don't understand that

posting face gains is scarier than underwear pics and other 6 month keto musings,1309,9xwzz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9xwzz4/posting_face_gains_is_scarier_than_underwear_pics/,98,1542495798.0,"Edit: Wow, thank you so much for the gold! ❤️❤️❤️

Tomorrow is my 6 month ketoversary and it really doesn’t feel like it’s been that long! I’m down a total of 44lbs. (33F 5’6” from 228 to 184) 

This week we’re going on vacation, so I ordered a new swimsuit online and dreaded it. When it got here yesterday, I was pleasantly surprised at how great it looked! Thank you, keto! I had to really dig for that “before” photo in the pink bikini top (June 2016).  I remember feeling cute in a 2 piece despite my weight and sending the photo to a friend. I had no idea how big I actually was 😬😬😬

I can finally see face gains! I honestly haven’t noticed a difference in my photos until the last couple of weeks. In this before photo (Obvs taken while eating a giant cheeseburger 😑)  I weighed 207 and felt great after losing 20 lbs on phentermine (which by the way made me rage at my poor kids, wrecked my muscle mass, gave me symptoms of HEART FAILURE, and I gained those 20 lbs back within a year of stopping) 

If you’re looking at this and you want to start, my advice is to just jump in! I know how long 6 months seems and how helpless I felt when I first started, but honestly these 6 months have flown by, just taking everything one day at a time. The months are going to pass either way, but you can choose whether you’re healthier and happier when they do! 

Other advice:  
     Meal prepping was the key to my success the first 3-4 weeks on keto. It made things so easy, there was no real reason to cheat when I could just as easily grab my healthy meal from the fridge. 
     
And don’t be afraid of protein! I aim for 120 grams per day to keep my muscle mass while losing. 
     
 I wouldn’t start IF at the same time as keto, but eventually,  it makes counting and hitting those macros a ton easier when you do it in fewer meals. (I eat twice a day) 

 Other than VERY OCCASIONALLY  for holidays, I don’t personally make keto-fied versions of the former foods that made me fat in the first place.  They’re usually high in fat, low in protein, and too easy to overeat, plus they keep the cravings for those foods going. 
  
If you’re a snacker or binge eater at certain times, give yourself something to do at those times that keeps you away from your kitchen! I used to snack at night so in the beginning, I just went to bed instead. 

My Macros are: 120p/76f/20c

I shredded the zucchini, red bell pepper and carrots together and put them into a large bowl. I then took all the rest of the ingredients and processed them all together into a paste as a ""binder"".  I then put it all together and mixed by hand until I felt everything was well incorporated.

“You either experience the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.”,1954,9wi1yf,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/9wi1yf/you_either_experience_the_pain_of_discipline_or/,118,1542085027.0,"This is a quote I recently heard that I will never forget. It made me think about keto. Keto isn’t hard, dying early from a crappy diet is hard. Erasing days of progress with one cheat meal is hard. The fact is, the pain of discipline hurts so so much less than the pain of regret. Show your friends, your family, and most importantly YOURSELF that you have discipline and that this is not a temporary fad for you. The weight isn’t coming back. This is a new way of life, and you are so much better because of it. ",1

🌿 Nutrition Research Study @ University of Glasgow on seaweed consumption and knowledge (UK participants only),3,jcbqja,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/jcbqja/nutrition_research_study_university_of_glasgow_on/,1,1602890472.0," Hey everyone,

My name is Mayra, I am a nutrition student at the University of Glasgow. I wanted to share with you my research study survey, since me and my research team are investigating what are the people's knowledge in the UK on seaweed as a food, awareness of health benefits/risks and if there is a growing interest in seaweed consumption.

Seaweeds are very typical in Japanese diets (e.g. in miso soups and in sushi), and also popular in other Asian countries, however, quite rare in western diets.

I would be so interested in hearing your opinions on this topic, since most of you probably have tried seaweeds as they are quite popular within vegans due to their nutritional value, especially in terms of protein and iodine.

This survey could be of particular interest for all of you, since one of the main focus of the study is iodine, a nutrient hard to obtain in vegan diets but really abundant in seaweeds. Also, for people interested in health, nutrition, and sustainability. That said, everyone is more than welcome to fill it in, and I would be so grateful to you for taking the time and helping me with my research!

Let me know if you have any questions by pm or in the comments section. I will post the survey link in the comments.

Thanks for reading this far ✨💛 have a great weekend!

To take part you must be 18+ and live in the UK. The survey takes 20-30 min. And in rewards for taking the time to complete it, you'll enter a ruffle with the chance to win a £50 voucher! I will post the survey link on the comments section.
